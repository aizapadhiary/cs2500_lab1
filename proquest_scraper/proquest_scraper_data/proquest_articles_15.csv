POLITICO LLC,"United States, Arlington","Jul 12, 2019",The Trump Bill of Rights,"President Donald Trump came close to rewriting the First Amendment while speaking to the kennel’s worth of right-wing lapdogs, trolls, conspiracy theorists and media hackers he convened at the White House on Thursday for his “Social Media Summit.”
Saying that Google, Facebook and Twitter were guilty of “discriminating against conservatives,” Trump vowed that “all regulatory and legislative solutions” available to the federal government would be used against the companies “to protect free speech.”
Rather than defining free speech in positive terms, Trump explained what free speech isn’t. “To me free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposefully write bad,” Trump said. “To me that’s very dangerous speech and you become angry at it. But that’s not free speech.”
If Trump thinks negative and critical commentary don’t qualify as free speech because they’re “dangerous” and make him “angry,” he’s reversed the First Amendment, which was designed to protect the right to say bad things about “good” things. It’s easy to imagine that Trump’s complete revision of the First Amendment would define freedom of religion as the right to attend a church of Trump’s choice, that the right to assembly was reserved only for people attending MAGA rallies, and that the freedom of the press belongs to those who praise Trump.
Following Trump’s idea to its logical extremes, what would the Bill of Rights look like if he applied the same judicial oomph to the other original amendments to the Constitution? Rewriting the Second Amendment to Trump's satisfaction could be done with just a few word changes. Rather than having a right to bear arms, the Trump rewrite would make gun ownership a duty. This isn’t far from Trump’s real-life position. In a June interview, he all but called for universal armament when he said that unarmed civilians were “sitting ducks.”
The Third Amendment, which forbids the military from using citizens’ homes as crash pads without consent, is the least controversial of all the amendments. Trump, who worships the military, could own the libs with a rewrite stating that the soldiers working on the Mexican border must lodge in nearby private residences. Homeowners who find themselves overcrowded by their military lodgers would be allowed to temporarily reside in our luxurious and spacious migrant detention centers.
Given the fury he directed at special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI for their investigations, I imagine that Trump would fork the Fourth Amendment into a two-parter. His enemies would have no protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. If you haven’t done anything wrong, you have nothing to hide. But searches directed against obviously innocent people like Trump and his associates would be forbidden. Remember his wailing in April 2018, after the FBI served a lawful search warrant on his then-attorney, Michael Cohen? Trump characterized the search, which helped secure a guilty plea from Cohen, as worse than a break-in. “It's an attack on our country,” Trump said. “It’s an attack on what we all stand for.”
Trump’s Fifth Amendment makeover would likely toss the “takings” clause. He's a long-term abuser of eminent domain; he believes that property owners have no right to keep their homes and businesses when he wants to buy them. But what to do about the right against self-incrimination enshrined in the amendment? Keep it as is? Maybe the best way out would be to privatize self-incrimination rights by allowing individuals to sign binding nondisclosure agreements with themselves.
The Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial would be reversed, informed by Trump’s history of dragging his feet in civil cases. Trump loves to sue, and because he’s such a deadbeat, his contractors tend to sue him back. The way Trump sees it, the longer the litigation, the greater chance his opponent will back down. In the famous Tesoro case, Trump’s attorney told architect Andrew Tesoro that he might win the lawsuit he had filed against Trump, but the mogul would make certain the case would last so long that he’d go bankrupt in the process.
The Seventh Amendment, which guarantees civil jury trials in federal court, would probably attract no interest from Trump. But the Eighth, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment would be trash-canned. He’s a proponent of torture, water boarding and other methods of “enhanced interrogation,” saying it “works.” In 1989, he called for the death penalty after a group of teenagers was charged with a Central Park rape. (The teenagers were later exonerated.)
I will leave Trumpian reformation of the Ninth Amendment, which Judge Robert Bork once compared to an impenetrable “inkblot,” to legal scholars. The Ninth might be the only Bill of Rights amendment in dire need of actual freshening, Trump or no Trump. It’s unlikely that Trump would take issue with the Tenth, which establishes the concept of federalism. So instead of rewriting the last two amendments, the unshackled Trump would probably award himself the wild card of an additional amendment to the Bill of Rights. Its wording: “If an incumbent president loses office in a reelection campaign, he shall not be removed from the White House without his consent.”

WP Company LLC d/b/a The Washington Post,"United States, Washington, D.C.","Jun 1, 2017",Md. gerrymandering lawsuit could impact 2018 voting map: The plaintiffs' attorneys have asked a federal court to quickly declare the existing map unconstitutional or bar state officials from enforcing it for the 2018 election.,"Seven individuals challenging Maryland's 6th Congressional District as unconstitutional are asking a federal court to overturn the state's voting map or block officials from using it in the 2018 election.
John Benisek, a resident of Williamsport, and other residents allege that gerrymandering by Maryland Democrats during the 2010-2011 redistricting process violated their First Amendment rights, diminishing the ability of Republicans to elect candidates of their choice for the congressional seat now held by Rep. John Delaney (D).
Plaintiffs' attorneys deposed some of the state's leading Democrats, including former governor Martin O'Malley, who said he felt a responsibility to make the seat more winnable for Democrats. The seat was held at the time by Roscoe Bartlett (R), and O'Malley led the redistricting effort.
On Wednesday, the attorneys filed a motion asking a three-judge panel with the U.S. District Court in Maryland to declare the map unconstitutional or issue a preliminary injunction blocking the state from enforcing it, arguing that ""any further delay risks irreparable injury with respect to the forthcoming 2018 election.""
The plaintiffs are arguing that Democratic state officials who designed the district relied heavily on advanced mapping software, voter-registration data and voting history to give an advantage to their party.
When asked whether he thought the revised district would help Democrats, O'Malley said in his deposition that it ""was certainly my hope, and it was part of my intent.""
O'Malley said state legislative leaders who took part in the redistricting process, including House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert), had the same intentions.
But Miller and Busch, in their depositions, said they did not seek to flip the district to the Democratic column. ""I voted for and supported what I would believe was in the best interest of the citizens of the state,"" Busch said.
Miller and Busch said they were largely unfamiliar with the data given to their staffs during the redistricting process, including metrics showing the chances of Democrats winning districts under various configurations.
""I didn't even review it,"" Miller said. ""It wasn't important to me.""
In redrawing the 6th Congressional District, state officials moved more than 360,000 residents out of the district and a roughly equal number of people into it.
Before the change, Republicans made up nearly 47 percent of registered eligible voters within the boundaries, compared with about 36 percent for Democrats. After the new lines were enacted, Republicans made up 33 percent of registered eligible voters in the district, compared with 44 percent for Democrats.
The Cook Political Report's partisan voter index, which estimates the propensity for districts to vote Democratic or Republican, showed that the 6th Congressional District flipped from an R+13 in 2010 to a D+2 in 2011, the largest swing in the nation that year.
""There is no plausible explanation for the wholesale geographic, demographic, and political reshuffling of the Sixth District other than the attempt to dilute Republican votes to make it impossible for them to reelect Roscoe Bartlett,"" the plaintiffs' attorneys said.
Bartlett, who had consistently won reelection in the district by double-digit margins over two decades, lost the 2012 election to Delaney.
The result gave Democrats seven of Maryland's eight congressional seats. They previously controlled six.
The plaintiffs' attorneys claim that many constituents in and around the 6th District have been ""chilled from participating in the political process, not only because they feel that voting is a lost cause in light of gerrymandering, but also because they feel disconnected from their congressional district.""
During the depositions, Miller was asked about talking points his staff had provided for various speaking engagements at Democratic events. One of the items said the revised 6th District ""gives Democrats a real opportunity to pick up a seventh seat in the delegation by targeting Roscoe Bartlett.""
Another memo said: ""If asked about redistricting, keep it simple. We're going to do our best to help Democrats, while following all of the applicable federal and state constitutional and statutory requirements.""
Miller played down the talking points, saying he generally speaks off the cuff during speeches. He described the notes as ""political rhetoric"" designed to inspire Democrats and not necessarily guiding principles for the redistricting process.
The case is Benisek v. Lamone.

CQ Roll Call,"United States, Atlanta","Feb 6, 2017","Interview With Kellyanne Conway; A Visit to the Border; Confrontation With Iran, U.S. Tensions with Iran Examined; President Trump Criticizes Media; Super Bowl Reviewed","(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
SEAN HANNITY, HOST (voice-over): Tonight. The legal battle over President Trump's temporary travel ban continues. Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway is here with reaction.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The border is soft and weak. Drugs are pouring in. And I'm not going to let that happen.
HANNITY: Then, our ""Hannity"" producers did a ride-long the Border Patrol to see how bad things really are today on our southern border. Geraldo Rivera weighs in.
TRUMP: The men and women of the United States military -- they're the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the earth.
HANNITY: And President Trump outlines his vision for America's military, and also the looming showdown ratcheting up with Iran. We'll check in with Colonel Oliver North and he'll react.
TRUMP: Much of the media, not all of it, is very, very dishonest.
HANNITY: Plus, President Trump fights back against endless smears from the abusively biased press. Larry Elder, Mercedes Schlapp respond,
""Hannity"" starts right here, right now.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: And welcome to ""Hannity."" A fierce legal battle is brewing over President Donald Trump's extreme vetting executive order as liberals and the left continue to be willing to gamble with the lives of you, the American people. And that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue.""
So the legal back and forth is complete and total nonsense because we shouldn't even be at this point in the first place. And here's why. Now, this is a classic example of activist judges ruling based on their own personal opinions and not on what the law actually says -- judicial activism -- because if you look at the U.S. code that pertains to President Trump's executive action -- let me put it up on the screen.
It reads, quote, "" Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the U.S. would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants, non-immigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions that he may deem to be appropriate.""
Now, Daniel Horowitz, our friend over at Conservative Review -- he wrote an article entitled ""Rogue judges undermining our sovereignty, and here's how Congress can stop them."" Now, in it, Horowitz argues that the judiciary branch of our governor, especially on the lower levels, has been utterly polluted by progressive judges who decide rulings that are based on personal or political opinions, not on the law, not on standing, not on the Constitution.
So in other words, a lawsuit can be brought before a liberal judge -- they can go judge shopping -- or in a liberal-leaning court, and it can have a national impact, like what we are seeing playing out. Now, according to Horowitz, Congress should work to take back their power from these activist courts in order to protect you, the American people, our sovereignty and the rule of law.
Now, for example, the U.S. 9th circuit court of appeals, where this legal battle is now playing out, is known by all to be the most liberal federal appeals court in the country. And if you look at the Seattle-based federal judge, James Robart, who put a temporary halt to the president's extreme vetting executive order on Friday, well, he has a history of questionable rulings. And according to The Seattle Times, during a hearing last year on police reform, well, Judge Robart -- he declared, quote, ""black lives matter, and of course, all lives matter.""
And then there is the out-of-control liberal hypocrisy that is on full display here. For example, Senator Chuck Schumer -- he's calling foul over the president's executive order, but what the Senator is not telling you, that back in 2015, he actually said a pause on admitting refugees into the country could be necessary.
Then there's the two most recent Democratic presidents. They argued in favor of tougher immigration laws. Let's take a look at Bill Clinton. This was back in 1995 during a State of the Union address. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BILL CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All Americans, not only in the state's most heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.
We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Nation of immigrants, nation of laws. It's self-defeating. Doesn't that sound a lot like President Trump now. It does, right? Now, of course, back when President Clinton said it, there was collective outrage from the left? Never happened.
And if that's not enough for liberals, there's also President Obama. This is him back in 2014 saying this. Let's look at more hypocrisy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Today, our immigration system is broken and everybody knows it. Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we're also a nation of laws. Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable. If you're a criminal, you'll be deported. If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up.
The actions I'm taking are not only lawful, they're the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and ever single Democratic president for the past half century. And to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer. Pass a bill.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Wow. There you have it. Now, the only reason liberals are resisting President Trump's action on extreme vetting is they're trying to score cheap political points. Now, it doesn't matter that President Obama and Congress came up -- they're the ones that came up with the list of seven countries that President Trump referred to in his executive order. And liberals -- they don't seem to mind one bit that according to The New York Post, visa holders from these seven countries that have ties to terror and extremism are now rushing into the country while they can, thanks to the courts.
Now, President Trump's policy is very straightforward. Instead of twisting and misrepresenting Donald Trump's intentions, well, the left should listen very closely to what the president said earlier today. Listen closely, especially if you're a liberal.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We need strong programs so that people that love us and want to love our country and will end up loving our country are allowed in, not people that want to destroy us and destroy our country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: My message to the left tonight is very clear. You want to keep playing games, you go right ahead. But know this. If one American loses their life, is killed as a result of letting in dangerous, unvetted people into this country, you are to blame and you will have blood on your hands and you can explain that to the American people why you put politics ahead of their safety.
Earlier today, I spoke to the special counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway, and here's what she said.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: Kellyanne, good to see you.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Hi.
HANNITY: You know, you look at the history of all this, seems to be to be all politics, great hypocrisy on display. What if somebody that is not vetted is killed (sic) in the meantime? What does that mean? Are they willing to gamble with American lives?
CONWAY: Well, this is the president's entire point, Sean. He has a right, he has a responsibility, the authority, and indeed, the duty to protect Americans, and that's what he's trying to do here.
The statute that you read, the past comments from liberals like President Obama and President Bill Clinton are very closely aligned with what President Trump is trying to do now as our commander-in-chief and president.
We find that the particular order coming out of the Seattle judge is overly broad. It's a nationwide injunction. He referenced religion, when, in fact, that has nothing to do with the executive order. It's not in there. And the fact is that we don't even know if these states that sued have standing. Individuals have standing and individuals usually need to show harm and damages.
HANNITY: You know, the other thing is the total dishonesty here. I'm going to put up on the country -- on the screen, 43 countries, OK, majority Muslim countries representing 90 percent of the world's Muslims are not included in the ban, including Indonesia, 258 million Muslims, Egypt 95 million, Bangladesh 156 million, Pakistan 201 million.
But the news media keeps saying it's something it's not. That's got to be frustrating when they say it's a litmus test, as Chuck Todd has said, a religious test or a Muslim ban. What is your reaction to the false reporting?
CONWAY: Well, the reaction is that President Obama himself said that these same seven countries needed special screening. They weren't just picked out of a hat. They are -- they were actually designated by President Obama and the Congress as needed special screening. They have a tradition and history of training, harboring and exporting terrorists. And we've seen that.
And I know there's article that's not getting much play today that I really want to call to everybody's attention. It's in the Associated Press by Eric Tucker. And he basically fact checked Judge -- the judge in Seattle, Judge Robart, and said the judge was incorrect when he said that no one has been arrested for extremism under this kind of...
HANNITY: I pointed that out on my radio show. That's -- you're exactly right.
CONWAY: Well, I appreciate that. And this is such an important thing for everybody to know because the judge from the bench had asked the attorney how many people have actually been arrested under this type of order, and she said, I don't know. And he said, I'll tell you, zero. And that's just not true. And I'm sure that everybody can look at Eric Tucker, Associated Press. I don't hear the media covering this. This should be the biggest story of the day in that -- especially since...
HANNITY: He was wrong!
CONWAY: ... they're -- you know, he was wrong, but he did it from the bench. You know, all of us are wrong once in a while, Sean, and we apologize and immediately rectify it, but this is the judge who then said that the -- issued a nationwide injunction from the bench in Seattle in the 9th circuit...
HANNITY: Yes.
CONWAY: ... and was just wrong from the bench in what he said about what this type of extreme vetting would provide or could have prevented had it been in place earlier.
HANNITY: You know, Kellyanne, there are many countries that if you have an Israeli passport, they don't -- Muslim countries that do not let you in their country just because you have an Israeli passport. I want to put up on the screen and show you something. This...
CONWAY: That sounds like a religious test.
HANNITY: Yes, that does sound like a religious test.
CONWAY: And this is not.
HANNITY: Democracy matters strategic plan for action. This was discovered by The Washington Free Beacon. It involves David Brock. And inside this memo, it has plans for defeating Trump, A, through impeachment, through government misinformation, the midterm elections, and more importantly, filing lawsuits against the Trump administration.
So that's pretty much telling me that they're going to judge shop for the next four years to defeat the administration on every agenda item. How do you combat that?
CONWAY: You combat it by doing what the president's already doing, which is and showing progress and solutions and forward-moving action on behalf of people, and then they'll get it. They'll see who is against them. They'll see who's actually making a positive difference in their lives. In just the first two weeks on the job, this man has boosted wages, created jobs, opened up the pipelines, Dakota pipeline, Keystone pipeline, taken us out of TPP, made sure that factories that can stay here and not go to Mexico or workers going to -- or labor going to China, production going to China, that that stops.
He, of course, has met with manufacturing CEOs. He has reversed corrosive regulations that are hurting small business owners. You know, presidents are judged by their accomplishments over time and the real impact they've had on people. And Sean, I can't tell you, for all the negativity out there towards the president and towards all of us here at the White House how many more people across this country write us, text us, e-mail us, call us, stop us wherever we are and just say, Thank you. Thank you for trying to make a difference. Thank you for taking the fire and making a difference.
Now, if the professional left wants to continue with this permanent campaign and never actually accept the results that this is everyone's president and he is trying to do good for everyone, then they'll have to -- then people can judge for themselves.
I mean, I think the left is not off to a really good start. They sound like a bunch of crybabies.
HANNITY: They are crybabies.
CONWAY: And speaking of hypocrisy -- speaking of hypocrisy, what about all these Democratic senators who voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to a federal appeals court...
HANNITY: Unanimously.
CONWAY: ... already 10 years ago? What's changed now except for politics? So the hypocrisy there -- the American people can see that. They can see what these protesters are really saying, what they're really about, and they can judge for themselves. They can protest. Here at the White House, we're going to make progress.
HANNITY: All right, Kellyanne, great to see you, as always. Thank you for taking time.
CONWAY: Thank you, Sean.
HANNITY: I know you're busy every day.
Now, coming up, a ""Hannity"" special investigation. We sent our cameras down to ride along with the Border Patrol this weekend. Look at what they found, among many things, 400 pounds of drugs. That's coming up next. We'll also get reaction from Geraldo.
And also tonight...

TRUMP: The men and women of the United States military -- they are the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the earth.

HANNITY: Is a showdown with Iran imminent? President Trump visits U.S. Central Command earlier today. Colonel Oliver North is here with that and more tonight as ""Hannity"" continues.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(NEWSBREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Mexico with the United States has out-negotiated us and beat us to a pulp through out past leaders. They've made us look foolish. We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico. On top of that, the border is soft and weak. Drugs are pouring in. And I'm not going to let that happen.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right, that was President Trump vowing to stop the cartel- fueled drugs and violence from pouring into our country from Mexico. So the question is, just how bad is the situation down at the southern border? Now, last week, we sent one of our producer to Arizona to check it out for you, and what they found once again is shocking. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How far south are you?
AGENT VINCENTE PACO, U.S. BORDER PATROL: We have (INAUDIBLE) type of fencing here that allows us to see through the fence and address any threats that might be approaching the fence. This is where the pedestrian fencing ends. We're about five miles west of the city of (INAUDIBLE) .
The terrain in this location is, as you can see, is very rugged.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This here is referred to as a vehicle barrier. This used to be a known drive-through location where we have vehicles driving through. And right here is evidence that there's a lot of traffic through here.
This is a known drug smuggling route. There is evidence that drug mules come through this area because you can see that there's these bundle straps. These bundle straps here are used to tie the bundles together, and then they're -- you know, they put them up like that and make them into, like, small backpacks.
For somebody to walk all the way this way, they probably already walked a day in Mexico before they cross into the United States because there's really no towns out here.
Right now, we're about a mile southeast of Aho (ph), Arizona. So we had air support, picked up a group of suspected drug mules in the area. One agent interdicted a group, and he has contraband with him. While agents were responding, one of the agents came across what seems to be abandoned marijuana.
Doesn't look like it's part of a group we're working, but sometimes we get close to the area and drug mules abandon their load and then they run back to Mexico to avoid apprehension.
Each of these barrels weighs around 50 pounds. Thee are about 20 kilos a pack.
What we're going to do right now is we're going to try to get close to assist the other agent that they need right now. You know, we don't know if they're outstanding individuals. The good thing is that we got air support nearby (INAUDIBLE) going to try find a safe zone to land in and help them out with that.
By the time the agents showed up because they were up in the mountains, the smugglers have dropped their contraband. Good thing that we had air assets nearby where they were able to go respond and assist in the search of the bundles. So what we're going to do right now is we're going to break them down individually. Then we're going to tag them. We're going to weigh each one of Them.
Agents are weighing, breaking down the bundles individually. They're tagging them. What's going to happen from here is they're going to get eventually turned over to the Drug Enforcement Agency who ultimately takes custody of the contraband. Once we interdict it, the group -- the agents exhausted all resources available to look for the individuals. But you know, more than likely that they made their way back into Mexico once we -- once they knew we were moving into their location. As you can tell, they have the high ground when we were driving in, so they saw us moving into their location.
We interdicted a total of 18 bundles of contraband with a total weight of over 400 pounds of marijuana, these 400 pounds that are not going to make it into the streets today.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: 400 pounds caught in that raid alone. Joining us now with reaction to what you just saw, FOX News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera.
All right, I have been down 12 times -- horseback, all-terrain vehicle, boats, helicopters. Me on horseback was funny by the way. I have been to drug warehouses. I was there when gangs were arrested, gang members were arrested -- have it all on video. And the drug warehouse, floor to ceiling, the biggest warehouse you've ever seen.
Isn't this issue also not about the drugs and the cartels and the gang?. What if they were terrorists? What if they were bringing in nuclear material?
GERALDO RIVERA, FOX CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's an excellent question. I just want to compliment the producer. I don't know which one...
HANNITY: Dan Comb (ph).
RIVERA: Dan Comb. Well, congratulations to him because it's one thing to talk about drugs being smuggled, it's another thing to see the vivid graphic evidence of it right before your very eyes.
In terms of the wall -- and I think that's where the conversation has to go. I think the wall will stop casual drug dealers. It'll stop the pot smuggler. The question is whether it will stop the El Chapos. Remember, there are 75 tunnels that have been identified over the 2,000-mile border, 75...
HANNITY: I was in one. I was in one
RIVERA: And of course, I was in El Chapo's...
HANNITY: Right.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: I remember that, yes.
RIVERA: I think the pros will fly over it. They'll tunnel under it. They'll drive around it. I think it will stop the small-timers. And of course, now, as the United States legalizes pot and produce so much of our own now, I think that demand will drop...
HANNITY: Are you...
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Aren't you worried more about the heroin, the kids that try vicodin, percocet, oxycontin, and then move to heroin?
RIVERA: Go back to what you said earlier about national security and terrorists sneaking across. As far as I know, there has not yet been a verified penetration of our southern border by any terrorist, not yet. Thank God.
HANNITY: I don't believe that.
RIVERA: All I know is what the record...
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Here's what we do now.
RIVERA: Not yet.
RIVERA: We have a thousand ongoing investigations of radical Islamists in all 50 states. That's just a fact. Where they came from, we don't know.
RIVERA: But did you notice there was a fence in most of the area that you were talking about. So would a fence twice as high work twice as well?
HANNITY: Double fencing...
HANNITY: I'm not so sure.
HANNITY: ... across most of the border, and then there are other techniques. Here's the thing...
RIVERA: You know, I withdrew my objection. I think that if...
HANNITY: I know you did.
RIVERA: If you're willing to spend, if the taxpayers of the United States...
HANNITY: No, Mexico's going to pay for it.
HANNITY: ... are willing to spend up to $25 billion...
HANNITY: Yes!
RIVERA: I think that we have to see now -- and the most interesting thing is within the Republican Party, people like Senator John Cornyn and others -- of Texas and others, are saying, or beginning to say, Wait. As infrastructure priorities go, this is not the top of our list. We have to really make sure that there's a spending offset, where the budget doesn't go to hell (INAUDIBLE)
HANNITY: That goes for all spending. And I know that's a priority, but national security's got to be the number one priority.
Up next tonight here on ""Hannity""...

TRUMP: For proof that our nation has been blessed by God, look no further than the men and women of the United States military. They are the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the earth and that the world has ever known. The challenges facing our nation nevertheless are very large, very, very large. We're up against an enemy that celebrates death and totally worships destruction. You've seen that.

HANNITY: Very true. That was President Trump earlier today. He was talking to CENTCOM and hew as at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, his first trip as commander-in-chief to the headquarters for the U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command.
During his speech, along with praising our fighting forces, President Trump promised that radical Islamic terrorism will be defeated. Here now with reaction, the host of ""War Stories"" Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North.
All right, Colonel, let me just lay out a history here because there is a new sheriff in town. I don't think the media is seeing what's going on. General Flynn puts Iran on notice. President Trump tweets out, it's -- I'm not Obama. He was way too kind. Then sanctions are put in place. Then the USS Cole is positioned off the coast of Yemen which would have pretty quick access to the Straits of Hormuz.
Very different from Obama, 100 -- $1.7 billion, paying ransom, allowing them to spin centrifuges, 25 days notice for inspections, no U.S. inspectors, not any place, any time.
If I'm the Iranians right now, I think I'm thinking they -- he is preparing to go after my nuclear sites. Am I reading this right or am I wrong?
OLIVER NORTH, ""WAR STORIES"" HOST: Well, he's certainly taken nothing off the table, Sean. And the fact is, add to that little list of things that are happening out in the part of the world, the George Herbert Walker Bush, CVN-67 -- its carrier strike group is now in the Mediterranean headed east, and that ought to give them something really to think about.
The sanctions that he started last Friday target 25 IRGC members. That's the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, their businesses, the individuals, the bank accounts. And it's aimed at the suppliers who are aiding and abetting Iran's ballistic missile program.
And you don't need a ballistic missile program unless you've got a nuclear weapons program. So these are individuals and entities who are procuring the technology and the materials to support the missile program, and it includes those -- and I quote -- ""acting on behalf of or providing support to the IRGC Quds Force, which is, of course, their special operations units that are rampant in Iraq, some in Syria, certainly some down in Yemen helping the Houthis. So these (ph) unilateral course of sanctions like those are generally ineffective because fewer if any of those 25 entities are doing any business in the U.S. But...
HANNITY: I assume...
NORTH: ... here's the good news.
HANNITY: Yes.
NORTH: Let me just -- good news. You can fix that with a very simple amendment. In seven days, all business and banks doing any business whatsoever with the aforementioned Iranian entities and/or similar entities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the DPRK, will be barred from doing any business in the United States. That will stop that program.
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: The Iranian precipitated this by firing the ballistic missile tests that they had. Then they've been sabre rattling on top of that. We know Donald Trump doesn't want a protracted war, doesn't believe in a ground war. So we now have ourselves with a very complicated situation, a-squared, b-squared equals c-squares. Iranian Mullahs, the number one state sponsor of terror, if they get nuclear weapons, they said they will use them. Do you see a potential alliance with the United States, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, the Egyptians, Jordanians, and Israelis to take out nuclear sites that are very cleverly are spread all throughout Iran, many of them underground needing bunker busting bombs to get there. Do you think that that operation needs to be done? Whether or not they are planning or not, that's a different story. Should we take that action?
NORTH: I don't think we are going to have to.
HANNITY: Why?
NORTH: Quite frankly, if you look at what happened right after that deal was done in Vienna when Kerry announced it, King Salman in Saudi Arabia invited as guests for a conference El-Sisi from Egyptian, Abdullah from Jordan, Erdogan from Turkey, and Sharif from Pakistan. He also invited the two emirs from Abu Dhabi and Dubai. They all came except for Abdullah because he was targeted for assassination that day. He sent his chief of staff.
What was that meeting about? I'll tell you what it was about. Salman wants those weapons that he bought for the Pakistanis available to him. I think the mostly likely outcome of this is, one, an incredible proliferation of nuclear weapons around the rest of the world. That started with what Obama was doing. And number two, the kinds of things that might well lead to the cooperation that's now extant between the Israelis and the Saudis and the Sunni adversaries of the Shiite radicals in Tehran.
HANNITY: It's going to be it to watch this play out. I don't think people are paying close enough attention. This is ratcheting up quickly. All right, Colonel, good to see you, safe home.
And up next tonight right here on HANNITY.

Gannett Media Corp,"United States, Des Moines, Iowa","Nov 29, 2018",Inmates suing for right to porn: 58 plaintiffs seek to overturn new state ban,"Fifty-eight Iowa inmates are suing state officials in federal court, seeking $25,000 each in damages, claiming they have been denied a constitutional right to pornography in the state's prison system.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Des Moines, seeks to overturn a new state law that has shut down designated ""pornography reading rooms"" in Iowa's prisons. The law also prohibits inmates from having nude photos in their cells. The ban includes Playboy magazine, which has long been allowed in the state's nine prisons, which hold 8,575 inmates.
The plaintiffs — who are all inmates at the Fort Dodge Correctional Facility — are led by Allen C. Miles, 70, who is serving a life sentence for the stabbing death of Cheryl Kleinschrodt on March 3, 1982, in Des Moines. The suit claims the law was enacted under the guise of ""morality,"" and blames ""religious tyrants"" who have no regard for the U.S. Constitution or Declaration of Independence.
The lawsuit also contends that if female correctional officers employed in Iowa's prisons for men can't handle an environment that includes photographic matter featuring female nudity and related matters that ""they should find employment elsewhere.""
The suit was filed in late October and the changes took effect Nov. 14. U.S. Judge Robert Pratt in Des Moines has ordered each of the plaintiffs to pay a filing fee or to request that the fee be waived. He also told them to file a new complaint no later than Friday for the case to proceed.
The legislation — approved by the Iowa House and Senate and signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds — was part of a justice system budget bill approved at the end of the 2018 session.
The new law specifically says funds appropriated to the Iowa Department of Corrections shall not be used to distribute or make available any commercially published information or material to an inmate that is sexually explicit or features nudity.
The law reverses a policy in place for three decades since late Chief U.S. District Judge Harold Vietor upheld findings in 1988 that the state's prison rules on pornography were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.
Michael Savala, the Iowa prison system's general counsel, told state lawmakers during the session the legislation mirrors a policy currently used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Iowa prison officials believe the changes will withstand a court challenge from inmates, he said.
""The department really feels that inmates having access to that kind of material does not lend itself to pro-social thinking and behavior and as far as our responsibilities to change the mindset of the offender as they transition back into the community,"" Savala said.
Prison officials also said the elimination of designated prison rooms in which inmates could read sexually oriented material ends a staff-intensive process. Under the old policy, offenders would check out publications and be escorted to a private reading area. When the inmate was finished examining the publication, the magazine would be returned to a staff person, who would inspect it to make sure no pages were been removed and no contraband was inserted into it.
In addition, prison officials said the population of sex offenders has grown significantly in Iowa's prisons since the 1980s and 1990s and prison officials want to keep sexually oriented publications away from them.
However, during Senate debate on the bill, Sen. Rich Taylor, D-Mount Pleasant, a retired Iowa State Penitentiary employee, opposed the legislation. He contended the changes ignore the fact that male inmates have a sexual drive.
""That is just a fact and you have to have some way to relieve that,"" Taylor said. ""This gives the inmates no release point except another offender, and don't think that it doesn't happen.""
Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections, said incarcerated individuals were advised in July that the changes would take effect in mid-November. That gave inmates four months to stop subscriptions to sexually explicit publications and to make arrangements with family and friends, he said.

"Tribune Publishing Company, LLC","United States, Chicago","Oct 17, 2017",Crest Hill latest to ban sale of pets from 'puppy mills' after Chicago ban upheld,"Crest Hill has become the latest Illinois community to limit where pet stores may obtain the animals they sell.
The city council in the southwest suburb voted unanimously to ban stores from offering pets obtained from large commercial breeders.
In doing so, Crest Hill joins a handful of other local governments - including Chicago, Cook County and Waukegan - that have enacted similar bans, aimed at prohibiting pet stores from selling animals from so-called puppy mills.
Entire states are also getting further involved in the regulation of pet sales. In August, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner signed a law banning large breeders from selling to pet stores unless the breeders are licensed by the USDA and have no violations. And last week, California enacted a law requiring pet stores to sell only animals obtained from shelters or animal rescue organizations.
Crest Hill’s ordinance was passed after the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month affirmed the city of Chicago’s right to enact a similar ban in 2015. The appeals court upheld a lower court’s ruling that dismissed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the ban filed against the city by two Chicago pet stores and a breeding firm in Missouri.
Crest Hill’s new law “is essentially banning puppy mill setups, so we’re talking about large scale breeders who are only breeding these (animals) to make money and then passing them off to pet stores,” City Administrator Heather McGuire said.
Under the local ordinance, pet stores can still sell animals but only if they’re from a nonprofit animal care facility, shelter or rescue organization. Consumers may still purchase animals directly from private breeders.
“We are not closing the door to anyone going to a private breeder to get a puppy,” McGuire said.
The ordinance is intended not only to reduce the demand for animals raised in large commercial settings, but also to protect unsuspecting consumers from purchasing an animal that may suffer from health or behavioral problems because of poor care or inbreeding.
“Often, these animals that come from these large commercial breeders have sickness, injury, inbreeding, and pet stores are putting these animals with buyers who don’t know they’ll end up with an animal that will require significant medical attention, and may often have to eventually be put down,” McGuire said.
Crest Hill has one pet store, Puppy in the Window, which relocated last year from Joliet.
The owners of Puppy in the Window could not immediately be reached for comment. McGuire said she believes the owners have decided to close the store, whose methods have been criticized by a local animal welfare organization, Safe Pets for Joliet.
Founder Morgan Drdak said measures such as the one passed in Crest Hill are not aimed at driving pet stores out of business, noting that only a small percentage of the tens of millions of dollars spent on the pet industry is for the purchase of animals themselves.
“The tide is turning,” Drdak said. “On Friday, the entire state of California did this. We’re not surprised, and we’re hoping that more communities - whether they have a pet store or not - will go ahead and be proactive. This is how we can make a difference, this is how we can shut down the puppy mills, this is how we can change the way that animals are treated when they’re bred.”
But Mike Bober, president of Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council, a national trade group representing the pet industry, said ordinances such as the one passed in Crest Hill may make it difficult for pet stores to source dogs from shelters and rescue groups if they refuse to work with the stores. Furthermore, he said the measures ignore the protections already offered to consumers.
“The biggest problem here is that breeders who sell through pet stores are licensed and regulated - that protection, that assurance regarding the source does not exist if you’re buying off of Craigslist or if you’re looking at a dog from a third-party source,” Bober said. “There are protections that people seem to overlook. ... And our concern is that in a desire to do something to address a legitimate concern, towns like Crest Hill are actually doing more harm than good.”
He also questioned why Crest Hill would move forward with the ordinance without giving the new Illinois law a chance to work.
“It seems to me that Crest Hill has unilaterally decided - even before that state law has had any chance to go into effect - that there is no such thing as a responsible breeder,” Bober said.

Reason Foundation,"United States, Washington","Sep 3, 2020","FOSTA Is Unconstitutional, Argue Sexual Freedom Advocates and First Amendment Lawyers in New Motion: Plus: People have doubts about democracy, Washington state sues Juul, and more...","The Woodhull Freedom Foundation is suing (again) to get FOSTA ruled unconstitutional. FOSTA—the 2018 ""human trafficking"" law making it a federal crime to host digital content that promotes prostitution—violates the First and Fifth Amendments, says Woodhull's motion for summary judgment, filed in federal court on August 31. It also takes aim at the law's retroactive scope—FOSTA says you can be punished for violating it even before the law went into effect.
The suit comes after a federal district court dismissed an earlier filing against FOSTA, brought by Woodhull—a nonprofit dedicated ""to affirm[ing] and protect[ing] sexual freedom as a fundamental human right""—and fellow plaintiffs The Internet Archive, Human Rights Watch, Eric Koszyk, and Alex Andrews. In January, a federal appeals court reversed the decision and sent the case back to the district court.
You can find their full motion for summary judgment here (and find previous court filings here). ""Plaintiffs request a declaratory ruling that FOSTA is unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against its enforcement and application,"" the motion states. They claim that ""FOSTA is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, is a content-based statute that cannot satisfy strict scrutiny, and lacks the necessary scienter requirements to be constitutional"" (scienter refers to a person's intent when doing something that the government claims is criminal). ""And it explicitly is meant to have retroactive reach in both its criminal and civil applications.""
Meanwhile, the SAFE SEX Workers Study Act, introduced by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) to pave the way for FOSTA's dismantling, has gone nowhere since its introduction last December. Several civil lawsuits—two against Craigslist and one against Mailchimp—are invoking FOSTA in order to accuse these tech companies of being legally liable for ""sex trafficking.""
Woodhull and the other plaintiffs are represented by Lawrence G. Walters of the Walters Law Group, Bob Corn-Revere of Davis Wright Tremaine, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

Doubts about democracy.

In this case, the decline has come entirely among Republicans,"" Pew notes.
The poll was conducted from July 27 through August 2 and consisted of 11,001 U.S. adults.
A majority of those surveyed (62 percent) agreed ""that significant changes are needed in the fundamental design and structure of American government to make it work for current times."" Pew points out that ""while views among the public overall have changed little since 2018, Democrats and Republicans have moved further apart in their opinions. Currently, 79% of Democrats say significant changes in the structure of government are needed, compared with 41% of Republicans.""

"Ogden Newspapers, Inc.","United States, Marshfield, Wis.","Mar 29, 2019",Some of lame-duck laws return after ruling: Appeals court overturns judge's invalidation,"MADISON - Some of the lame-duck laws limiting the power of Gov. Tony Evers went back into effect Wednesday when an appeals court overruled a Dane County judge who invalidated them last week.
A three-judge panel in Wausau stayed the ruling by Judge Richard Niess, but the court did not act on a separate ruling in a second case that blocked parts of those laws.
For now, those provisions — including ones taking power from Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul — remain sidelined. An appeal in the second case is expected soon, and more court action in both cases is expected in the days and weeks ahead.
Wednesday's ruling immediately raised questions about whether 82 appointees of former Gov. Scott Walker continued to hold their jobs. Niess' ruling invalidated their confirmations last week and Evers quickly rescinded their appointments.
After the appeals court ruled, the two sides disagreed on whether Evers' action stood and whether those jobs were vacant.
While the questions swirled, GOP leaders savored their victory at this stage of the legal fight. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said Wednesday's ruling pauses a ""constitutional crisis.""
""Established law says that the court cannot tell the Legislature how to set its rules,"" they said in their statement.
Meanwhile, Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said, ""The only victory today is for the $500-per-hour Chicago lawyers getting paid by taxpayers to defend the Republican attack on our constitution.""
At issue in the cases are laws Republican lawmakers approved after Evers and Kaul were elected but before they were sworn in.
The laws limited Evers' control of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., required Evers to get permission from lawmakers to make changes to public benefits programs and forced Kaul to get approval from lawmakers to settle lawsuits.
The League of Women Voters of Wisconsin and other groups sued, asking the court to vanquish the lame-duck laws because of the method legislators used to bring themselves into session.
Lawmakers held what is known as an extraordinary session, in which they convene at the Capitol when they're not otherwise scheduled to be there. The groups argued state law and the state constitution don't allow such sessions.
Niess agreed and issued a ruling that blocked the laws and revoked the confirmations of 82 Walker appointees approved by the Senate during the lame-duck session.
After that decision, Evers and Kaul immediately took actions that had been blocked by the lame-duck laws.
Kaul sought to withdraw the state from lawsuits challenging federal environmental rules and the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Evers revoked the 82 appointments.
On Wednesday, the appeals court blocked Niess' ruling while it considers the case. The judges concluded that Wisconsin residents may suffer harm if laws passed by their representatives are prevented from being carried out while the court does its work.
The stay was granted by Mark Seidl, who was elected in 2015; Thomas Hruz, who was appointed by Walker in 2014; and Lisa Stark, who was appointed by Walker in 2013 just before the election. She was the only applicant.
Misha Tseytlin, an attorney for the lawmakers, said the latest decision put the 82 Walker appointees back in their jobs.
""Those people have a statutory right to their jobs because they were duly confirmed by the Senate in December 2018,"" he said by email. ""The governor's hasty, ill-advised actions last week cannot possibly impact those legal rights.""
Baldauff disputed that.
""The stay does not invalidate the withdrawal of the appointees, nor does it affect the governor's ability to make appointments to those vacant positions,"" she said by email.
Most of the positions are on low-profile, part-time boards that provide their members nominal pay. But two of them are for full-time positions — on the Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, and the Labor and Industry Review Commission, which reviews employment law decisions.
Wednesday's decision was the latest in a string of rulings that have come over the last week.
In a separate case brought by unions challenging the lame-duck law, Dane County Circuit Judge Frank Remington on Tuesday blocked some of the provisions of the laws while he considers the case. His ruling remains in effect for now, so those parts of the laws continue to be on hold despite the appeals court's ruling.
An appeal in that case is expected to be filed soon.

Dear Colleague: Education has long been recognized as the great equalizer in America. The U.S. Department of Education and its Office for Civil Rights (O.C.R.) believe that providing all students with an educational environment free from discrimination is extremely important. The sexual harassment of students, including sexual violence, interferes with students' right to receive an education free from discrimination and, in the case of sexual violence, is a crime. Title IX of the Education
Last year, the phone rang in the office of the New York attorney Andrew T. Miltenberg. On the line was Tom Rossley, a trustee for 23 years at Drake University in Iowa. His son, Thomas, had just been expelled after a woman accused him of rape, and Rossley, such a longtime booster that he was sometimes called Mr. Drake, was on the verge of being kicked offthe board for protesting the verdict, he believed.
While a trustee's son might be expected to receive favorable treatment, Rossley thought that possibility had been eclipsed by the school's greater urgency to demonstrate how seriously it took sexual assault, because it was under federal investigation at the time for supposedly mishandling a victim's complaint two years earlier. ""I'm not definitively saying it didn't happen,"" he told Miltenberg. ""I'm not saying it did happen. What I'm saying is we don't know, and they didn't really want to find out.""
As Rossley would explain to Miltenberg, on the night in question, Thomas, then 21, met up with a woman in his circle of friends. Each had drunk heavily. According to the school investigator's report, the woman remembered Thomas having sex with her in his dorm room, her telling him to stop and him stopping. But Thomas, who said he'd had the equivalent of 15 drinks, didn't recall having intercourse and woke up fully clothed. Rossley noted what he believed to be many flaws in the process of his son's case, including the school investigator's not accepting key witnesses - among them Thomas's roommate, who claimed he was present in the room the entire night. Although in the classroom Drake accommodated Thomas's lifelong language-based learning disability, which made communication difficult, he was leftto defend himself in a nine-hour hearing, in which he frequently stumbled and was asked to speak up. (Drake declined to comment on the details of the case but broadly disputes the Rossleys' characterization. In court filings, the school said Thomas could have introduced additional witnesses at the hearing and did not request disability accommodations.)
Rossley had contacted Miltenberg to ask him to handle their suits - Thomas's claiming gender discrimination and due-process violations, and Rossley's for retaliation after the board removed him. Miltenberg's name was easy to find because by then he had established a reputation as ""the rape-guy lawyer,"" as a colleague describes him, or ""the due-process guy,"" as he sometimes calls himself. To Miltenberg, the Rossleys' experience showcased ""the disparity between how men and women are being treated"" under Title IX - the federal law that prohibits gender discrimination in schools that receive public funds - and demonstrated how campus responses to sexual assault have become driven by internal politics and institutional fears.
A 52-year-old New York City native, Miltenberg spent most of his career on business litigation, often involving defamation. That work brought him his first college case in 2013, when an international student called to say he had been falsely accused of rape. It wasn't defamation - the school found him responsible for nonconsensual sex - but Miltenberg thought it could be something else - a violation of due process. To him, the handling of the case seemed unfair: The student, whose English was weak, told him that he wasn't told about resources available to him. The father of the accuser was on the faculty, and his colleagues judged the case. ""There's an old saying among lawyers: Justice is not the result, it's the process,"" Miltenberg says. ""We give ourselves over to a system. We lose, we win. We hate losing, but you are able to at least say: 'I couldn't have asked the judge to do more than he did. He listened, he thought, he read.' Here you are not having that experience.""
Miltenberg lost the case but found a calling: addressing what he saw as a crisis in campus Title IX processes, as universities around the country, he felt, overcorrected after decades of failing to take student sexual violence seriously enough. In the years since, Miltenberg estimates, he has represented some 150 students - almost exclusively men - in campus Title IX proceedings and around four dozen lawsuits against schools. His cases include the accused man in Columbia's ""mattress girl"" scandal and the Colorado State University-Pueblo football player who was suspended despite the supposed victim's denying she was raped. Miltenberg's two oldest children, who are twin brother and sister, just began their sophomore year of college, and if either were involved in a sexual-assault case, he says he would worry more about his son's treatment than his daughter's. He has developed a fearsome reputation among college administrators and the adulation of men's rights activists, who believe feminism and politically correct campus culture prop up accusations from women who regret consensual sex. But he is also the focus of enmity from victims' advocates, who see his efforts as feeding a backlash. He has suggested that if a campus assault isn't ""bad enough to report to the police, then maybe it shouldn't be reported."" By his own admission, he has badgered Title IX officers to disclose whether they themselves were rape victims - an experience he believes fosters in them a ""religious"" conviction that ""only a crazy woman would fabricate a report.""
In the past year, Miltenberg's cause has widened into a public debate about whether the effort to ensure women's safety has come at the expense of men's due-process rights. An already polemical fight sharpened when President Trump's administration came into power and began to methodically dismantle Obama-era policies. Miltenberg has said that Trump's election, despite sexual-assault allegations, demonstrated that university practices are out of step with public opinion. Many of Trump's advisers signaled support for accused men, as did the 2016 Republican platform. His secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, has donated to a group that supports accused students' rights, and to temporarily lead the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, which enforces Title IX compliance, she picked Candice Jackson, a conservative activist who told The New York Times in July that 90 percent of campus-rape allegations are dubious - mired in alcohol and relationship drama. (Jackson later apologized.) In September, DeVos declared current policies a ""failed system"" of ""kangaroo courts"" and ""weaponized"" civil rights, vowing that ""the era of rule by letter is over.""
A decade ago, Title IX was better known as the law that forbade schools to banish women's sports teams to the parking lot while men got the fields. Schools were required to address campus sexual assault under both Title IX and the 1990 Clery Act - a federal law, named for a Lehigh University freshman raped and killed in her dorm room, that requires colleges to report all campus crimes - but schools were only rarely sanctioned under the act, and few students knew how to lodge Title IX complaints. Reporting to law enforcement offered little help: Federal statistics compiled by the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network show that only 310 out of 1,000 rapes are reported to the police. Just 11 of those are referred for prosecution, and just seven lead to felony convictions. Even if the criminal-justice system pursued sexual-assault allegations more aggressively, college victims would still have to face the accused on campus as investigations and prosecutions drag on for months, or even years.
In 2011, following an investigation by NPR and the Center for Public Integrity on campus assault, the Obama administration decided to act. The Office for Civil Rights sent a ""dear colleague letter"" reminding colleges that sexual harassment and assault create an environment so hostile that women's access to education is jeopardized, violating their civil rights. The letter noted a commonly cited (though commonly challenged) statistic from the National Institute of Justice that one in five women are victims of attempted or actual sexual assault during college. A subsequent clarification of the letter created no uniform policy for how schools should adjudicate cases, but it offered recommendations like having schools inform students that drinking ""never makes the survivor at fault for sexual violence"" and discouraging colleges from allowing either party to directly cross-examine the other in investigations. Schools that failed to uphold standards risked losing federal funds.
Colleges responded by creating new Title IX offices and drafting individual policies that varied from school to school. Some universities use hearings; others employ a ""single investigator"" model, in which a school designee is responsible for both investigating and making a determination. More typical is something like this: After students disclose an assault to a ""responsible employee,"" that staffmember must relay it to the Title IX officer, who determines whether a full investigation is warranted. If it is, the officer taps a staffmember or external investigator who has been trained in Title IX procedures to contact the parties, interview witnesses and gather evidence. Complainants are asked to participate, but schools can proceed without them if they decide the claim poses a larger threat on campus. A report is produced that each party can comment on, and panel hearings are held. Until this September, Office for Civil Rights rules stipulated that all of this needed to happen within 60 days, and afterward, the parties could appeal.
Campus reporting of sexual misconduct spiked significantly, and that increase led to an outcry from conservative media, including writers for National Review and Town Hall, which argued that the guidance letter made accusations as good as a verdict. The day the Office for Civil Rights sent its letter, the federal government made ""all sex unsafe on campus,"" the libertarian magazine Reason said.
The most widespread criticism was that the letter forced schools to lower their standard of proof when assessing claims, to the ""preponderance of evidence"" standard commonly used in civil lawsuits. Unlike the higher standard used in some civil trials, which require ""clear and convincing evidence,"" or the highest standard used in criminal trials, which require certainty ""beyond reasonable doubt,"" preponderance is often described as 50.01 percent certainty of guilt. If an accused student is found more likely than not to have committed the offense, he or she is ""responsible,"" in the parlance of campus hearings. While there were exceptions before 2011 - schools that used ""clear and convincing"" or, in a few instances, ""beyond reasonable doubt"" - preponderance was used in about 80 percent of colleges that had any fixed standard.
Victims' advocates argued that it followed an established legal principle: In civil cases, where criminal penalties aren't on the line, the burden of proof is lower. But critics viewed the mandate to use preponderance as a means to finding more accused students responsible, and the standard became a sort of shorthand - that college men were no longer presumed innocent and were being expelled en masse over ""regret sex.""
It was an oversimplification, but also one that reflected real problems in the process. To Joe Cohn, the legislative and policy director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a nonpartisan nonprofit that works on free speech, religious liberty and due process in higher education, the larger issue is that the lower standard exists within a ""parallel judicial system"" that lacks other due-process protections - like the consistent right for attorneys to meaningfully participate in hearings and access to the legal procedures to investigate complex cases. Schools can't subpoena witnesses to compel relevant testimony or put people under oath; they rarely have access to forensic evidence or processes for discovery.
""O.C.R.'s rationale"" was that preponderance of evidence ""was the standard for suits alleging civil rights violations like sexual harassment,"" wrote Nancy Gertner, a retired federal judge and current Harvard law professor, in The American Prospect in 2015. ""True enough, except for the fact that civil trials at which this standard is implemented follow months if not years of discovery."" She continued: ""It is the worst of both worlds, the lowest standard of proof coupled with the least protective procedures.""
In 2016, FIRE, which had been connecting accused students with lawyers and offering a class to attorneys on handling complaints, put out a recruitment call for plaintiffs to sue the Department of Education over the guidance letter. There was already an abundance of lawsuits against schools - at least 190, according to the men's advocacy group Title IX for All. Typically, victims' complaints about mishandled Title IX cases have gone to the Office for Civil Rights, while complaints from accused men land in civil court. In a ruling involving Brown University last year, a Rhode Island judge noted: ""A student is not entitled to a perfect disciplinary process, and it is not the court's role to be an appeals court for Brown's disciplinary decisions."" At the time, no circuit courts had weighed in, but there were so many cases it seemed one would have to. This September, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals did so, finding that the University of Cincinnati violated an accused student's due-process rights by failing to let him cross-examine his accuser.
With funding from right-wing donors like the Charles Koch Institute, FIRE has often aligned with conservative sensibilities. But a number of academics and lawyers, among them a group of feminist Harvard law professors (including Gertner) who released a public letter in August calling for reform, have cited reasons Title IX policies should concern progressives, too: that overly broad definitions of misconduct, encompassing most drunken encounters, threaten to erode distinctions between consensual and nonconsensual sex; that anecdotal evidence (there's little hard data available) suggests men of color are disproportionately punished; that a conservative administration could co-opt the campus-rape debate to further its own aims; or that perceptions of bias could trigger a backlash casting women as liars.
""I concede I've seen cases where it seems schools were taking shortcuts to justice,"" says S. Daniel Carter, a longtime campus-safety expert who consults with colleges and universities about sexual misconduct. But schools that did so, he emphasizes, were violating policy or breaking the law. He points to a September 2017 study released by FIRE that found that most top schools fail to consistently ensure 10 safeguards it considers ""fundamental elements of due process"" - like providing adequate written notice of allegations and the need for impartial fact-finders. With the exception of two items on FIRE's list - one calling for a presumption of innocence, which Carter believes violates Title IX's requirement that adjudicators make no presumptions whatsoever - Carter says not only that he agrees with every principle but also that each is already required by Title IX, the Clery Act or the guidance letter.
In the case of Thomas Rossley, which Andrew Miltenberg joined when father and son decided to sue, the Rossleys contend that Drake violated some of these policies. The school's acting dean was afforded equivalent speaking time as Thomas and his accuser - effectively doubling the amount of time allowed to make the case against Thomas, which the Rossleys argue is a violation of Office for Civil Rights guidelines. Although Drake's Title IX coordinator noted in an affidavit that the only way the school could comply with Title IX was to waive the school's requested time, the dean still spoke. ""They basically put in writing: 'We're not going to comply with Title IX in this prosecution,' "" Rossley says. (In a court filing, Drake denies violating any rules or procedures.)
Victims' advocates say that cases like this illustrate that the problem isn't the policy but rather schools' failing to follow it. A situation where a school gave more time to one party than the other, says Alexandra Brodsky, a fellow at the National Women's Law Center, would be ""both a clear error by the school and points to a need for a more nuanced conversation about Title IX enforcement than 'Is Title IX good or bad?' ""
""For my entire career, I've seen the pendulum swing,"" Carter says. For decades, schools followed ""the path of least resistance,"" he says, to the detriment of victims. More recently, some followed the same path to the disadvantage of the accused. Now that pattern of reaction and counterreaction is happening at the national level. ""It's not back and forth so much as it's the same old failed system,"" Carter says. ""Who is it failing the most today?""
""It's becoming, I don't know if 'circus' is the right word,"" says Laura L. Dunn, the executive director of the national victims' rights group Surv- Justice, but ""it's so legally complex that it's not an easy thing to step into."" School officials are being named in individual lawsuits, so fewer agree to serve on Title IX panels; self-identified victims increasingly need lawyers of their own, because they risk being sued. Advocates on both sides suspect that schools are hedging their bets as they adjudicate, fearing both lawsuits and Office for Civil Rights sanctions.
In the past six months, two different professional attorneys' associations have reviewed campus sexual-misconduct policy, and a third's assessment is underway. They've come to different conclusions - one proposing higher standards of proof, another access to all evidence for accused students. The American Bar Association task force's recommendations led to disputes even within the A.B.A. ""I don't think either side of this issue has advocates that are completely imagining problems,"" says Cohn, who admits that no proposed solutions - including FIRE's - come without costs to either side. ""There isn't a perfect, utopian answer to the problem.""
But under the Trump administration, these complexities are being cast largely as a matter of overregulation. Secretary DeVos, who has argued that local authorities and parents should have greater control over education than the federal government, seems to have taken a similar approach with Title IX. When she had one of her first official conversations about Title IX last April, it wasn't with national experts on either side, but rather with a combative Republican state representative, Earl Ehrhart of Georgia, who has argued that Title IX enables rampant false allegations and that schools have no business investigating sexual assault. Ehrhart came away from his meeting gratified that DeVos seemed to agree with him on the limited role federal authorities should play. ""She's placing this back where it belongs,"" he told me, ""in the purview of the states.""
In January 2016, Representative Ehrhart, a former chairman of the American Legislative Exchange Council, which drafts model bills for conservative state legislators, decided, after hearing from the distraught mother of an accused student, to make Georgia the testing ground for challenging the ""dear colleague letter."" A conservative with a penchant for bomb-throwing who has been lampooned by a Georgia reporter for delivering ""Wagnerian"" pronouncements, he began with what he called his ""Georgia Tech hearing."" At the time, Georgia Tech had a mandatory-expulsion policy for students found responsible for rape, and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that it had expelled or suspended more students for sexual misconduct than any other Georgia state school. It also then used the controversial single-investigator model. Ehrhart, as chairman of Georgia's House Subcommittee on Appropriations for Higher Education, wielded his financial authority like a weapon, effectively denying Georgia Tech funds to expand its libraries and warning other colleges to be more concerned about losing his support than that of the Office for Civil Rights. ""If you don't protect the students of this state with due process,"" he said, ""don't come looking for money - period."" Some victims' advocates believe he leveraged his role again in pushing the state's Board of Regents to overhaul its sexual-misconduct procedures. The board announced new rules, including banning the single-investigator model, which went into effect in mid-2016.
That April, Ehrhart and his wife, represented by Miltenberg, sued the Department of Education, challenging the dear colleague letter on the claim that Ehrhart's stepson, a Georgia Tech student, could ""be wrongly accused and found responsible."" Then, early this year, Ehrhart proposed a bill, H.B. 51, which initially mandated that any campus sexual-assault report be forwarded to the police, with or without the complainant's consent, and forbade schools to take final disciplinary action for any possible felony until there was a conviction or a no-contest plea.
The complexity around campus sexual misconduct has led observers from diverse political backgrounds to call for turning the whole matter over to the police. In a forthcoming law-review article, Brodsky notes that since 2013, at least six states and Congress have considered bills that included some form of law-enforcement reporting. Some mandated that schools refer complaints regardless of victims' wishes; Congress considered a bill that prevented colleges from proceeding with Title IX processes until the police were at least notified, or in some cases, until a conviction was obtained. But no state bill before H.B. 51 took such an extreme approach - or so flagrantly contradicted federal law. And because state bills cannot override federal law, H.B. 51 seemed intended to force a court challenge to the dear colleague letter.
That, Ehrhart acknowledged, was the point. When we met in Atlanta in March, over Chick-fil-A sandwiches, he said he hoped ""Georgia will hang a light on the problem such that the O.C.R., the D.O.E., will be put in a position: 'Here's a state statutory enactment that's 180 degrees different from the old guidance letters. What are we going to do?' "" Given the Trump administration's signaling its distance from the dear colleague letter, he wagered that if H.B. 51 passed, the new Office for Civil Rights wouldn't withdraw federal funds. Then other states would see that they could challenge the letter without repercussion and would follow suit.
The H.B. 51 fight was ugly. Hundreds of student protesters went to the state's Capitol, where legislators challenged women seeking to testify about their assaults during a preliminary hearing. Ehrhart reprimanded one group of victims, saying: ""If you feel triggered, trigger somewhere else."" Men's rights activists showed up to lobby, at times targeting individual activists. They speculated on social media that one student organizer was a ""pretty little liar"" and brought to the Capitol a man suspended for having assaulted another.
The backlash Ehrhart mobilized created collateral casualties of its own. In his Georgia Tech hearing, Ehrhart read aloud a letter from the mother of a man expelled after being found responsible for rape. The expelled man had sued, and while his accuser wasn't a defendant, her name and identifying details were in court documents then available to the public. It was a threat that her attorney, Lisa Anderson, who represents victims pro bono as executive director of Atlanta Women for Equality, feared was a new tactic: essentially outing women who lodged Title IX complaints.
There were threads about her case on the school's Reddit page; riding a bus across campus, she sat in stricken silence as two students discussed it and decided she had probably made it up. Sidelined by panic attacks, she withdrew from most classes by the end of the semester, and though she tried to return last fall, she ended up leaving again and was hospitalized for a week after becoming suicidal. Her G.P.A. slipped so low that she told me she fears that she can't transfer elsewhere, and that her only chance to graduate is to wait for the current crop of Georgia Tech students to cycle out.
At Kennesaw State University, one woman found that as the Georgia debate around Title IX grew, her case was caught up in the furor. According to her complaint, early one morning in February 2016, she was raped by a male friend, when consensual fooling around ended in nonconsensual intercourse that she explicitly refused. At first, she told me, she thought her friend had merely ""disrespected"" her clear line. She let him spend the night, and in the morning they ate breakfast, making plans to meet later. The man didn't call, and the woman, troubled, talked to friends, who told her she was describing rape. Her mother took her to the hospital and the police, and school officials were informed. K.S.U. started an investigation. (The man denied that they had intercourse.)
But over the summer, as the new Board of Regents policy went into effect, the woman claimed the tone shifted. In her last interview, she says, investigators asked whether she was calling the situation rape because the man hadn't called. Nonetheless, they found him responsible and recommended a two-semester suspension. (The man's attorney, Lisa Wells, said the K.S.U. office fell out of touch for nearly five months, leading her client to believe the matter had been dropped.)
In the lead-up to a planned hearing in October 2016, the man argued that the investigation had been biased and hadn't adequately considered his evidence. He asked that his case be reheard under the new regents' policy and requested a stay of his decision ""until the enforceability of the 2011 dear colleague letter has been adjudicated"" - suggesting that Ehrhart's lawsuit might settle the point. The request for a stay was denied, but the school agreed to have an external reviewer assess the case. When they informed the woman, she received a list of new witnesses for the man's defense; among them was Ehrhart.
""I had no clue who he was or what he could possibly know about somebody raping me,"" she said. ""As soon as Ehrhart's name came up, everything went crazy, and they dropped any care they had for me."" As a representative of K.S.U.'s district, Ehrhart had substantial ties to the school. He co-owned a sprawling sports complex that partnered with the university, and when K.S.U. needed a new president in 2016, Ehrhart championed the appointment of the state's conservative attorney general, Sam Olens, who served with Ehrhart on the board of a K.S.U. business accelerator.
In the fall of 2016, Lisa Anderson, who represents the woman in the K.S.U. case as well, began to notice that email records K.S.U. sent had redactions in the ""cc"" line - a third party being kept abreast of the case. After filing multiple records requests, Anderson found emails involving Ehrhart, Lisa Wells and Olens. In one, Ehrhart wrote to Olens: ""This is the second of the absolutely ridiculous cases I was concerned about. I label this one 'breakfast with a rapist' made for TV absurdity."" He noted he was drafting new legislation to remove such ""nonsense"" cases from university jurisdiction and his belief that ""with a new administration in D.C., the guidance letters are now garbage, and the threat of federal funding is offthe table."" In closing, he appeared to request a specific outcome: ""I also hope this case can be dealt with in an expeditious manner benefiting its absurdity.""
Olens forwarded the email to the K.S.U. Title IX coordinator. When an external reviewer's report came back in early 2017 - around the same time Ehrhart introduced H.B. 51 - it reversed the initial decision. (Wells says Ehrhart's emails could not have influenced the external reviewer's findings because they weren't forwarded to her. K.S.U. officials said they were unable to comment on a continuing matter.) When Anderson and the woman appealed in the spring and summer, a process that finally culminated in a hearing this October, the panel declared that both parties were equally credible, so it couldn't find the man responsible. Even before the verdict, the woman had become so despondent that she decided to withdraw. Wells says her own client is suicidal.
Ehrhart's bill ultimately failed to pass before the legislative session closed in March, staved offlargely by the mobilization of student activists. But if he lost the battle, it would come to seem he had won the war. After DeVos rescinded the guidance letter, he was elated. ""We're back to pre-2011,"" he told me. ""In many ways, we've succeeded.""
""We in the advocacy community, who have been involved with Title IX for decades, understand this is nothing short of a catastrophe,"" says Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, which in 1977 was one of the first organizations to argue in court that sexual harassment violates Title IX. But the exact nature of that catastrophe is not yet clear. The language in the Office for Civil Rights's rescission letter and interim guidance is vague enough to allow for different interpretations. It might forbid accusers to appeal. Ehrhart hopes for this but acknowledges that ""they didn't make it crystal clear.""

It's an explosive story.
We're going to ask the attorney general about it directly in just a minute.
Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The first-ever meeting between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader has finished. President Trump and Kim Jong-un met one another in Singapore, put their names on a new deal that seeks to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula.
What's in the deal and what else has happened in the summit's wake. For that, we go to chief national correspondent Ed Henry who is in Singapore right now. Ed?
ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, great to see you. President Trump came, he saw, and he got a deal despite all the naysayers trying to talk down the possibility of American success before, during and after these talks.
The president tonight, in fact, is going to go on offense, try to sell this deal on ""Hannity"" next hour, telling Fox that Kim Jong-un is going to start denuclearization virtually immediately with the document they signed here, which he says could save millions of lives by preventing nuclear war.
Remarkable, coming just weeks after North Korea again threatened a nuclear conflict. During one of their walks together, Kim was actually overheard, through his interpreter, telling the president these pictures were so surreal that many in the world will ""think of this as a form of fantasy from a science-fiction movie.""
Democrats like Chuck Schumer tonight are warning this may be an actual fantasy since Kim made no specific commitment to get rid of his nukes, while the president promised to end joint military exercises with South Korea. That has some of our allies concerned.
But Republicans like Sen. John Kennedy today think, on balance, this is a good agreement. Kennedy saying today that, working with Kim is like hand- feeding a shark. You can do it, but you've got to do it very, very carefully. Tucker?
CARLSON: Great metaphor. Thanks, Ed.
Is the new deal with North Korea actually a deal? Is it good for the United States? Can we trust North Korea to follow it?
Doug McGregor is a retired US army colonel, author of the book ""Margin of Victory"". Congressman Jeff Fortenberry is a Republican, represents the State of Nebraska. And both of them join us tonight.
Congressman, first to you. Is this a deal Americans ought to be happy about?
REP. JEFF FORTENBERRY (R), NEBRASKA: Well, the best word that I can use to describe the last few days, in my mind, is stunning. I think the president's actions here are bold, they're historic, it's almost unimaginable given where we were just six months ago, where we were on the precipice of some type of even potential nuclear exchange
The president has leaned into something pretty radical here. And perhaps, he's creating a new architecture for 21st century diplomacy.
He has said to Kim Jong-un, we're going to deal with you, for good or for ill. And if it's for ill and you move your finger toward a nuclear button, we're going to hurt you. But if it's for good, I want to create the space for perhaps authentic dialogue and even friendship. And I think he accomplished that.
He has rejected the norms of ossified proceduralism and stagnation that governed so many international affairs and he took a bold risk and I think delivered something very important. It's his first step. We're holding out hope, obviously, for a greater vision. That could evolve here, but it's an important and good first step.
CARLSON: Ossified proceduralism. A phrase I'm stealing. Colonel, are you as optimistic about it?
COL. DOUGLAS MCGREGOR (RET), ""MARGIN OF VICTORY"" AUTHOR: Extremely. I think this is Donald Trump's finest hour. And I'm absolutely serious.
Donald Trump has recognized something that others have refused to see for a very long time in Washington. It's not simply that North Korea is on the ropes. It is. It's on the verge of collapse. Donald Trump understood that. And that's one of the reasons he was able to put the pressure on North Korea the way he did.
But he also went to great lengths in his meetings with President Xi, to forge an understanding with China. He treated President Xi as an equal, treated China as an equal.
And I think Donald Trump understands something that is not well understood in the Pentagon at this point or in many other places in Washington, and that our competition with China is essentially economic and technologic, it is not military. And that was the key development because, without China, none of this would have happened
CARLSON: Yes, that's right. And I think it clearly stemmed from what he said about trade with China.
Congressman, there's been a lot of criticism of this deal from the left, along the lines that the president is giving away important American advantages in exchange for nothing. How would you respond to that?
FORTENBERRY: This is the combination of foreign policy realism and entrepreneurial diplomacy. And as I said, this is not only about potentially preventing a conflict and opening up a new chapter and rejecting a stalemate of the last 65 years with North Korea, but it also could signal a new way, a new architecture for diplomatic relations moving forward.
Look, the world is screaming for some type of new interpersonal ecosystem both in our homes and in our communities, as well as between nations.
And what that means is that we have to have the ability to reach out and provide authenticity and dialogue and create some space because the world is racing toward destructive technology, and then what?
Civilization itself is at stake and we've got to find a way forward toward mutuality and well-being and mutual security. Or else, we don't have much hope.
CARLSON: But, I mean, colonel, a lot of what we have heard liberals, and some conservatives, by the way, criticize the idea that you meet with someone who is morally out-of-bounds, like Kim Jong-un. Going forward, should we be willing to meet with anybody?
MCGREGOR: Oh, absolutely. And I think Donald Trump is a disruptive force. Let's be frank. He's disrupting the status quo. Lots of people in this town are very upset because this threatens to change the distribution of cash. This threatens budgets. This threatens support structures. This threatens a number of things.
He recognized early on when he was campaigning that South Korea is a powerful state, infinitely more powerful than North Korea and quite capable of defending itself.
He recognized that Japan is also in the same position. In fact, if Japan raises its investment in the military power by just 1 percent, Japan will be number three in the world in terms of its defense budget.
He understands that what Northeast Asia wants and needs is stability, order and prosperity, not war. And I think he's got the agreement of everyone who counts in the region.
CARLSON: That's an amazing statistic about Japan, by the way, which most of us consider demilitarized. Apparently not.
Colonel, congressman, thank you both very much.
FORTENBERRY: Thank you.
MCGREGOR: Thank you.
CARLSON: What effect will this summit have on the rest of Asia? A meaningful question for the rest of the world.
Michael Pillsbury is the man to answer. He's a senior fellow and director of China strategy at the Hudson Institute. Author of maybe the single best book recently on China called ""The 100 Years Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower"". Dr. Pillsbury joins us tonight.
So, what effect, Michael Pillsbury, does this have on the rest of Asia, if any, right now?
MICHAEL PILLSBURY, ""THE 100 YEARS MARATHON"" AUTHOR: Well, it doesn't have much effect on the rest of Asia until more is revealed by President Trump on the what the next steps are going to be. He has laid the foundation for moving forward.
He's sent Secretary Pompeo up to Beijing. I myself have heard from the Chinese already that they are taking credit for this. They are a little bit hurt that President Trump did not give them any credit when he was in Singapore.
They feel they sent the plane, they put the pressure on, they did the sanctions, they voted for these UN Security Council resolutions three times and made the toughest sanctions in history. They all but pushed Chairman Kim into this. And here is their friend, Donald Trump, not tipping his hat to them.
But the president, as you know, is not finished talking about this.
CARLSON: To think of the Chinese Politburo as having a heart and being - having its feelings hurt, that's so interesting.
PILLSBURY: Well, we don't care if their feelings are hurt. I'm going to Beijing tomorrow. So, I've got to be careful what I say, Tucker.
CARLSON: Yes.
PILLSBURY: But I would say the reaction in Asia depends on how much concern they had about - any given country had about nuclear weapons in North Korea.
So, down in Southeast Asia, this is not really a topic. They are much more concerned about the South China Sea. Is the US really going to have some ships that go inside the 12-mile boundary and then have helicopter operations or swerve around and not request innocent passage?
This is not a technical matter. Under the law of the sea, there are five things that, if you do that, you are saying I dispute this claim. We have not done those five things.
We usually go in with our radar turned off. We don't do swerving turns. We don't launch helicopters. So, we are recognizing the Chinese claim. At the same time, we are mildly challenging. This is a big issue in Southeast Asia.
In Taiwan, they're still waiting for the F-16 replacements. They asked for 55 F-16 jet fighters about ten years ago. Forty-eight or so US senators wrote a letter. They held up the deputy secretary of state give these jet fighters to Taiwan. They are for sale. They're not fully gifts. That has still not happened. So, Taiwan is kind of wondering what is their future?
In Japan, they've got a series of issues they want to hear more about. So, the North Korea issue, as you know very well, Tucker, is really a bit more about the United States feeling vulnerable to kind of a crazy person with H bombs and 50 ICBMs, if that's what it should come to.
That problem seems to be taken care of. So, Americans can be happy. We can admire President Trump. He's done something for us.
But the rest of Asia is still awaiting for answers to a broader Asia strategy, I think, and President Trump is working on that. That's what his team has been telling me.
CARLSON: I'd be worried if I was in Taiwan. Michael Pillsbury, thank you very much. Great to see you.
PILLSBURY: Thank you.
CARLSON: Just a few months ago, the press was upset about President Trump's overly aggressive posture toward North Korea. Now, they're claiming he's too friendly to North Korea. We'll try to make sense of that. Next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: It was just a few months ago that the press was in love with North Korea because of their impressive Olympic delegation and publicly feared President Trump was about to start a war with them. Remember that?
Well, during yesterday's summit, the president was friendlier. So, was MSNBC happy? No. And here's a selection.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST, ""DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE"": It is not knowable that we will ever know really what happened in that meeting business both men are known and established liars.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would say it's somewhat disgusting. It is actually a debasement of the American flag.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Donald Trump can relate to authoritarian. As a former businessman, he likes absolute control.
CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST, ""HARDBALL"": Is he a wannabe despot?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have conceded that for years now.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: And the frenzy continued over at ""The Washington Post"". Ishaan Tharoor said that the summit showed Trump's ""affinity for dictator"". CNN analyst and avid pro-war activist Max Boot dismissed the whole summit as something any US prior president could have achieved, though none did.
In ""The Week"" magazine, Damon Linker said that even a successful summit would be bad because it would improve Trump's approval ratings and that ""could only be considered positive if you think it's a good thing for our mendacious, hapless, impetuous, racist president to enjoy an unprecedented boost to his popularity."" In other words, if it works, that's bad because Trump will benefit.
Joe Concha covers media for ""The Hill"" and he joins us tonight. So, you've been watching the coverage, Joe. Sum it up for us.
JOE CONCHA, ""THE HILL"" MEDIA REPORTER: Well, that last line is interesting because it sounds a lot like, Tucker, Bill Maher on Friday night who said bring on a recession even if it cripples families and people across the country because that would be the only thing that could get Trump from being reelected.
And by the way, Maher is worth something like $100 million. He gets 10 million a year.
CARLSON: Yes, I know.
CONCHA: So, when Trump is gone, who cares if we go to war or if we go to recession as long as liberals can triumph in terms of getting rid of Trump. That's all that matters.
I noticed that montage. It's very interesting. You played Nicolle Wallace. And she used to be a member of the Bush administration, right? She was the communications director.
You played Elise Jordan who is a member of the Bush administration. I heard Jeremy Bash who was in the Obama administration in the DoD.
What do all of these people have in common? They all worked in administrations that failed miserably in stopping North Korea's nuclear program.
So, if you're a viewer and you're sitting at home, you have to ask yourself this very question, why are we listening to these people? I mean, they failed in Iran, Syria, Iraq, you name it, depending on the administration, and they are presented as experts when, obviously, they have an agenda because they want to protect their own legacies or the legacies of their bosses.
It would be like turning to Jack Kevorkian to teach a class in the Heimlich Maneuver. It's a complete contradiction.
CARLSON: That's a very good point.
But couldn't it be said - well, no, it's apt. But couldn't that be said of so many different issues in which analysts on television are implicated in failing policies that were rejected by voters. And so, why wouldn't their contempt be baked in? Why wouldn't they hate all of this because it basically points up how badly they did their jobs?
CONCHA: Right. And it's the uncouth president that is actually succeeding in this case. I understand the criticism completely around whether this is a success or not because they're very broad strokes.
But then again, we're in the first out of the first inning. And unless every ""i"" is dotted and ""t"" is crossed and is being considered a failure, but to your point earlier with another guest, think of where we were in August when President Trump said that North Korea will see ""fire and fury"" like the world has never seen.
And if you go back and read those headlines, we are on the precipice of World War III. Guam was being threatened. We had actual maps of what nuclear missiles could hit Los Angeles, Chicago, New York.
CARLSON: Yes, I remember.
CONCHA: Think of where we were then and think of where we are now in terms of talking to this leader, having them agree at least in broad strokes around denuclearization. That is progress.
No matter how you try to spin it, that has to be seen as progress except it's not presented that way because there is always a reflex to the negative when it comes to this administration, even in the most obvious situation when there really isn't much negative things to complain about when you put it in the full context.
CARLSON: Very quickly, is there any indication that any of these self- described experts knows anything about North Korea at all?
CONCHA: I don't know if many people know much about North Korea, right? I mean, how many of them have actually been there? Any journalist for that matter or any experts in this regard?
So, I would say no. And again, when you have a Clinton, a Bush and an Obama administration that failed over 25 years doing the same thing in terms of nice talk and appeasement and then somebody else comes in and does something different, you are in no position whatsoever to complain about these things.
And that's the final point I want to make, Tucker, that we're very good in this business about complaining about stuff and that's all I've heard over the last 48 hours - complaint, complaint.
But when you are watching this coverage, listen for this. Is anybody offering an alternative or a solution as to what they would do as opposed to what they have witnessed over the last 48 hours? Because I haven't seen it yet, Tucker.
CARLSON: But how about just stand back and be amazed for a minute? Because it is amazing. That's how I feel about it anyway. Joe, great to see you.
CONCHA: Stunning. Your guest used stunning before, and that's correct.
CARLSON: It's true. Thanks. Up next, Attorney General Jeff Sessions just reversed an Obama era policy that promoted migration from Latin America. He's here to talk about it.
And also to respond to a remarkable new story. Fox News is reporting Rod Rosenstein, deputy AG, threatened Republicans on the House Intel Committee. That's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Attorney General Jeff Sessions occasionally endures Twitter criticism from his boss, but that has not frozen him into inaction.
Just yesterday, the attorney general reversed an Obama-era policy that granted asylum to migrants who claimed they feared gang violence or domestic violence in their home countries. It turns out the overwhelming majority of those applications were false. The attorney general joins us tonight. Mr. Attorney General, thanks for coming on.
JEFF SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: Hey, thank you, Tucker.
So, I want to ask you about this. But, first, I have to ask you about a piece of breaking news. Our Catherine Herridge just has out saying that, in January of this year, January 10, Deputy General Rosenstein went up to the Hill and met with Republican members of the House Intel Committee, had a dispute with them and threatened them with a subpoena of their emails and phone records.
This is what one of them said. ""I read it as a not-so-veiled threat to unleash the full prosecutorial power of the state against us."" DOJ on background has confirmed that something like that did happen. What is that about?
SESSIONS: Well, I don't know that they have confirmed that exactly. In fact, the FBI director, the senior ethics attorney for the Department of Justice who was in the room, say that's a mischaracterization really of what occurred.
And it also, I think, indicates that there's been a breakdown of relationships when, in fact, since January, a great deal of progress has been made.
We understand in this department that we are accountable to the president, we are accountable to Congress and we need to be cooperative with them to produce as many documents as rationally and legally and properly as can be produced - to produce them and we've made tremendous progress in that regard really.
CARLSON: Did the deputy attorney general threaten to subpoena the email or phone records of members of the House Intel Committee?
SESSIONS: Well, I was not in the room and I can't speak to what occurred. All I can say is that the people - Chris Wray, the director of the FBI, and our senior ethics attorney was there and others and did not see it in that same fashion.
CARLSON: OK. So, as a factual matter, you don't think that that happened?
SESSIONS: I'm confident that Deputy Rosenstein, 28 years in the Department of Justice, did not improperly threaten anyone on that occasion. But we do believe that we have tried to be cooperative with them and made progress in months - as the months have gone by. And, in fact, have had some good relationships with the top members of Congress.
CARLSON: OK. So, you have made news recently by undoing an Obama-era rule about asylum-seekers. Give us the overview. I think most Americans like the idea that this would be a haven for people suffering around the world. Lots of people claim asylum. What do we know about the veracity of their claims?
SESSIONS: That's a good question. Seven years ago, 5,000 people applied for asylum claiming a credible fear of being at home in their home country and they needed to flee that country.
That number jumped to 94,000 in just seven years. It's overwhelming our system. Over 80 percent of those claims are being denied by the immigration judges as being not meritorious.
So, it is a big problem for us. Each one of those is requiring trials and factual decisions by our judges. We're going to add 100 judges, and that may yet not be enough judges to handle the cases.
We need to give the judges better guidance. They need to go back to the fundamental principles in laws and rules of the Immigration and Nationalization Act. And if we do that, then we are in a position where some of these cases can be promptly decided.
You do not get to come to America if you have a private threat or someone personally attacks you. You do not get to have asylum for that based on your race, your religion, your nationality.
If you are part of some special identifiable group that's being persecuted in your home country, that's what it takes to have an asylum and we need to get this straight. And I think it will help us, the decision I made.
I believe it's right legally and I'm totally confident it's consistent with the intent of the drafters of the INA, our law, and I believe it will help us manage our caseloads better and give more focus to the people who deserve to be given asylum and help us eliminate those that are not worthy of this asylum.
CARLSON: With over 80 percent of the applications are fraudulent, there's obviously a problem.
So, the DOJ has also recently weighed in on the question of speech on campus. What can the federal government, the Department of Justice do to ensure that people's First Amendment rights are protected? And why has it taken until 2018 to get DOJ involved in this?
SESSIONS: It's one of the big challenges of our time, I have come to believe, and it's almost unbelievable that major colleges and universities would be taking action that restricts the right of free speech on a college campus. It's just got to be confronted.
We have the authority under law to file a statement of interest in an ongoing litigation. So, cases are being filed against the universities by students who complain. And if we think their complaints are meritorious, then we can file a statement of interest joining with them and explaining why we, at the Department of Justice, think these concerns are real and justified and a court relief is appropriate.
So, we've had some success. We've had two cases where there has been a major change in the college and university's actions, and two cases where the judge has dismissed or rejected a motion to dismiss these cases by the universities, and allowing the trials to go forward.
We think it's a very important thing. Students should be participating in robust debate. They ought not to be intimidated. They ought not to be driven by political correctness to where you can't even speak up in class or on campus.
CARLSON: It's just amazing what an upside down world it is when a conservative attorney general is defending the First Amendments against liberals. It's like things have changed almost too much.
Mr. Attorney General, thank you. I appreciate it.
SESSIONS: Thank you. Good to be with you.
CARLSON: MS-13 gang members are menacing kids at a school just a few miles from the White House. Why are so many so determined to defend them? That is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Less than 10 miles from the White House, a middle school is being terrorized by MS-13. It's called William Wirt Middle School. It's in Riverdale, Maryland. And it's one of many whose makeup has been changed entirely and almost overnight by mass settlement of unaccompanied minors entering this country from Latin America.
Now, according to ""The Washington Post"", MS-13 members in the school start fights, sell drugs, rape fellow students. Teachers say they fear being alone with a lot of these kids. They also fear saying anything about it because speaking out could cost them their jobs.
It's a tragedy that can be traced almost entirely to US immigration policy, but elites don't seem to care at all and, in fact, crush any conversation about it by screaming ""racist.""
Needless to say, their kids will never attend William Wirt Middle School or anything even approaching it.
Jose Aristimuno is a former DNC press secretary and he joins us tonight. Jose, thank you for coming on.
JOSE ARISTIMUNO, FORMER DNC PRESS SECRETARY: Good to be with you.
CARLSON: What I found ironic about the story was this is this kind of third iteration of the MS-13 story. First, we were told they don't really exist, it's a figment of your racist imagination. Then we were told to attack them and call them names is immoral because they're good people.
And now, we have ""The Washington Post"" telling us in detail about how they've destroyed this middle school and are terrorizing the students. Are we allowed to acknowledge that or are we bigots for doing so?
ARISTIMUNO: Well, no. Let me start by saying this. If you're undocumented in this country, if you are a criminal including being a member of MS-13, we don't want you in this country and you should be deported.
Part of the issue here, Tucker, is that people like yourself and some Republicans want to pinpoint and just simply say because your first name Jose or you're Latino, like me, I'm automatically an ms-13 gang member. And that is not true.
CARLSON: OK. You're a ridiculous person for saying that. I have never suggested anything like that. It's appalling that you would say that. I don't think that and I've never suggested. You are speaking a lie, and not for the first time.
What I said is what I read in ""The Washington Post"", which is self- identified gang members are destroying the school and terrorizing people. I bet you don't have kids at that school. I bet you never send your kids to that school.
But you've got no problem with those people being in this country because it fits with the sort of demographic kind that you approve of. The truth is it's a disaster.
ARISTIMUNO: That's not true. I just said it, if you're an MS-13 gang member, if you're undocumented, you should be deported. A majority of people who are -
CARLSON: An undocumented - no, no. Then why have you consistently attacked anybody - yes, right. Nobody has said that the majority of immigrants are criminals or bad. I'm not saying that. I don't think it.
What I am saying is that -
ARISTIMUNO: The president has said that. The president has said that.
CARLSON: He has not said that. You are lying for political gain as always. What I have said and what I think many normal people have said is that we don't know who's coming into this country, we don't know anything about them.
There are 20 million of them living here. We don't know their identities, their background -
ARISTIMUNO: I've got an idea for you.
CARLSON: And some of them are bad people.
ARISTIMUNO: OK. So, you know what we do? Let me tell you what we do. We pass comprehensive immigration reform. We legalize a majority of people. It will be a whole lot easier, Tucker, to actually look for the real criminals if we legalize the good ones. Don't you think so?
CARLSON: I mean, it's hilarious if that solution comports exactly with your political goal, which is to create more Democratic voters.
ARISTIMUNO: Give me a break.
CARLSON: You tell me rationally how, if illegal immigration, the inability of the US government to know who is living within its borders, is the problem, how encouraging more of it, which is what amnesty would do, is the solution? There's no logic (INAUDIBLE) not something you're interested in solving.
ARISTIMUNO: OK. So, your answer and too many Republicans' answer is to deport the 14 million illegal immigrants, undocumented immigrants in this country.
CARLSON: We are guessing at that number. Some people think it's 20 million.
ARISTIMUNO: OK. 20 million, 14 million, what do we do.
CARLSON: When wage growth has been stagnant and the cost of everything is growing much faster than the growth in wages, you need to stop the ability of employers to hire cheaper people because they are here illegally.
We need to make e-verify mandatory. We cannot hire people here illegally.
No, no, no. Look, if you bothered for on anything about this subject, if you took it seriously and were bigger than a political issue to you, which it's not -
ARISTIMUNO: I take it very seriously.
CARLSON: No, you don't know nothing about it.
ARISTIMUNO: Give me a break. I am telling you, we have a choice to make as Americans. I know more than you. I know more than you.
CARLSON: Then should an employer - you know nothing. You know nothing.
ARISTIMUNO: I know more than you.
CARLSON: Why would an employer in this country be allowed to hire someone illegally, depressing wages for American citizens?
ARISTIMUNO: You want to fix that problem? We reform the system. We legalize the people that are already here. That's what we do.
CARLSON: You could do it, legalize it. You could do it tomorrow. Why should employers be allowed to hire illegal aliens?
ARISTIMUNO: I'm going to say it again. We have two choices.
CARLSON: Look right into the camera and tell me why they should be allowed to do that.
ARISTIMUNO: We've got two choices here, Tucker. We've got two choices. We deport the 14 million or 20 million, whatever number or we legalize them and put them in a path to citizenship, so we can actually get them out ","Carlson, Tucker; Henry, Ed; Concha, Joe",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2055355097/citation/53A3F5A27FE54AD9PQ/12?accountid=12826
