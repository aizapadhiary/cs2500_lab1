New York Times Company,"United States, New York","Jul 3, 2019",Appeals Court Upholds Ruling Blocking Trump From Using Defense Funds for Border Wall,"WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court in San Francisco on Wednesday upheld a block on President Trump’s attempt to use $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense to construct a wall along the southwestern border, impeding the delivery of one of his signature campaign promises. The divided three-judge panel in the Ninth Circuit agreed with a lower court’s decision from Friday that ruled the Trump administration did not have the authority to reallocate the funds without congressional approval. The administration immediately appealed. Two of the three judges on the panel affirmed that the administration could not build the barriers during future challenges. “We conclude that it is best served by respecting the Constitution’s assignment of the power of the purse to Congress, and by deferring to Congress’s understanding of the public interest as reflected in its repeated denial of more funding for border barrier construction,” wrote Judges Michelle Friedland, an Obama appointee, and Richard Clifton, a George W. Bush appointee. Judge N. Randy Smith, also a Bush appointee, dissented, calling the ruling “an uncharted and risky approach.” “This approach is in contradiction to the most fundamental concepts of judicial review,” Judge Smith said. “The majority has created a constitutional issue where none previously existed.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Sierra Club, hailed the freezing of the funds as a victory. “Congress and now two courts have said no to border wall funds,” Dror Ladin, a staff attorney with the A.C.L.U., said in a statement Friday. “For the sake of our democracy and border communities, it’s time the president come to terms with the fact that America rejected his xenophobic wall — and move on.” As a surge of migrants arrived at the United States border, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency in February to reallocate funds from counterdrug programs of the Department of Defense to build more barriers. This came after a monthslong impasse between the White House and Congress, and a partial government shutdown over funding construction of the wall. The move to reallocate the funds, which critics of the administration said contradicted the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution, was then challenged in two separate lawsuits. Judge Haywood S. Gilliam Jr. of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California temporarily blocked part of Mr. Trump’s plan to build the wall in May. On Friday, Judge Gilliam again blocked the efforts, describing the plan as “unlawful.” On Tuesday, a federal judge in Seattle blocked another attempt by the administration to deter migration. Judge Marsha J. Pechman of United States District Court for the Western District of Washington stopped the administration from denying a bond hearing to migrants who crossed the border illegally, which would have kept them jailed until they received a decision on an immigration case. The administration on Wednesday called that ruling “at war with the rule of law.” Word count: 498","Kanno-Youngs, Zolan",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2251472919/abstract/CF9F1F5A08324E69PQ/1?accountid=12826
Newstex,"United States, Washington","Sep 16, 2019",College Athletes Should Be Able to Earn Money From Their Likeness,"Scott Kinser/Cal Sport Media via AP Images Alabama Crimson Tide quarterback Tua Tagovailoa at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina  California Senator Nancy Skinner’s Senate Bill 206 would permit athletes to earn outside compensation from the use of their own name, image, and likeness (NIL)—and it unanimously flew through both houses of the state legislature. SB206, which now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature, has drawn sharp warnings from the NCAA, as the bill threatens its ability to exploit college athletes participating under its model of “amateurism.” Given the NCAA’s threats, one might assume that the bill’s passage would result in some cataclysmic event, threatening the very existence of college sports. Nothing could be further from the truth. The act would merely allow athletes to enjoy (almost) the same rights over their own identities that every student at their school enjoys, unencumbered by NCAA cartel restrictions. Even these rights are limited, as athletes could not enter into an agreement that conflicts with a team’s existing contracts. The prospect of returning even a portion of NIL rights to college athletes has prompted howls of dismay from the NCAA and its acolytes. On June 17, 2019, NCAA President Mark Emmert sent a letter requesting that the State Senate postpone consideration of the bill. More recently, the NCAA informed Governor Newsom that it regarded the bill as “unconstitutional,” signaling an intention to rely on the Constitution’s Commerce Clause to raise a legal challenge. The letter also claimed that SB206 would upend the “level playing field” that the NCAA claims it has supported in college athletics.  Those familiar with the O’Bannon v. NCAA case may be hard pressed to stifle their laughter upon seeing the NCAA trot out such risible, well-refuted claims. During the O’Bannon trial, plaintiffs’ counsel presented a quote from NCAA special advisor Wally Renfro, a 40-year veteran of the institution, who in an email titled “Financial Underpinnings of Athletics,” referred to Division I membership as “the haves, the have-nots, and the forget-about-its.” Indeed, so wide is the disparity that the “Power Five” conference football programs routinely make “guarantee game” payments to smaller teams. For example, Tulane received $1.94 million for playing SEC powerhouse Auburn earlier this year. In her O’Bannon ruling, District Judge Claudia Wilken, citing academic consensus on the matter, rejected the NCAA’s competitive balance justification, opining that: The NCAA does not do anything to rein in spending by the high-revenue schools or minimize existing disparities in revenue and recruiting … the major conferences—and the highest revenue schools—typically receive the greatest payouts, which hinders, rather than promotes, competitive balance. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Wilken’s ruling on this point. In the subsequent Alston v. NCAA case, the NCAA, perhaps sensing a lost cause, did not even request that the court reconsider its competitive balance justification for its restraint on athlete compensation.  Some athletes can already be paid in cash for their athletic talents. NCAA athletes competing in the Olympics receive cash payment for medaling in their sport. As CBS’s Dennis Dodd pointed out in 2018, University of Texas swimmer Joseph Schooling received $753,000 as payment for his gold medal from his native Singapore. He still won six medals at the NCAA championships. Kyler Murray received a $4.7 million bonus from the Oakland Athletics, yet remained eligible to quarterback the Oklahoma Sooners. As long as this was not football money, the NCAA concluded that he was eligible to keep playing, though his college baseball career was over. Clearly the NCAA’s real concern lies with the prospect that college athletes in the major revenue sports of basketball and football might receive something more than table scraps for the extraordinary sums they garner for their schools. Those arguing that athletes receive an “education” in exchange for their 40-plus hours per week of labor and the millions they bring to the school may want to revisit the long-standing academic fraud case at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, one of the most respected public universities in the nation. Nonetheless, the NCAA’s “level playing field” canard does signal at least an attempt, serious or not, to lean on Ninth Circuit precedent set in the 1992 NCAA v. Miller case, which involved NCAA sanctions against then-coach Jerry Tarkanian and the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. There, the NCAA challenged various provisions of Nevada statute NRS 398 that set forth the state’s guidelines for the imposition of NCAA sanctions upon any college or university in the state. The district court found that the Nevada statute was “significantly burdensome on the NCAA’s objective of maintaining a ‘level playing field’ within intercollegiate athletics.” The Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the practical effect of the regulation would have been to control conduct beyond the state’s boundaries. However, this finding has little relevance for the California State Senate Bill. State and federal legislators have begun to chip away at the NCAA cartel’s economic control over college athletes. South Carolina lawmakers recently announced plans to file a bill similar to SB206. North Carolina Representative Mark Walker has introduced H.R. 1804, the Student-Athlete Equity Act, which has been referred to the House Ways and Means Committee. Representative Walker’s bill proposes to “prohibit qualified amateur sports organizations from prohibiting or substantially restricting the use of an athletes name, image, or likeness.” Senator Chris Murphy has also taken up the cause of fair compensation for college athletes, a position highlighted in his recently-released “Madness, Inc” commentary. Vermont Senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders recently tweeted “College athletes are workers. Pay them.” So too has fellow candidate Andrew Yang. It should be clear then that SB206 is not a lone voice calling for change, but rather part of a growing legislative chorus calling for an end to the exploitation of college athletes. Moreover, the California bill does not prevent any other state’s colleges and universities from participating in the NCAA cartel’s collusive restrictions. Nor does it prevent California’s own schools from continuing to collude with other NCAA members to limit athlete compensation in other areas. The bill simply says that California universities cannot participate in cartel restrictions only with regard to NIL rights. In raising a Commerce Clause challenge on this issue, the NCAA would offer the absurd argument that SB206’s removal of a restraint on trade should be subordinate to a cartel’s nationwide imposition of that same restraint, a position at clear odds with the Sherman Antitrust Act. Any claim that the bill would “burden” interstate commerce is suspect for at least two other reasons. First, the bill does not impose additional regulations. Rather it deregulates, freeing college athletes from the economic restraints imposed upon their own identities by the NCAA, an economic cartel that has lost the last two antitrust cases it has faced. Second, the benefits to athletes are not local. Colleges and universities in California, like any other state, recruit nationally and internationally. As such, the NIL benefits would not be restricted by any state boundary. Further, any third party may compensate athletes competing for California schools in exchange for their NIL rights, not just California companies or individuals. The NCAA may also claim that the bill would give California schools a recruiting advantage over out-of-state competitors, particularly for players with the ability to monetize their NIL rights. However, California schools, including both USC and Stanford, have voiced their opposition to the bill. The sheer prospect of having to share their collusively-extracted gains with the labor that generated them apparently overwhelms any perceived recruiting advantage. The financial stakes offer some insight into why California schools oppose the bill. In 2016, UCLA signed a 15-year, $280 million apparel contract with Under Armour (see other schools’ contracts here). Apparel contracts can have implications beyond the athletic department. Documents from the UNC-Chapel Hill show that the school’s Nike contract included $2 million used by the chancellor to protect non-tenure track positions in the College of Arts & Sciences, School of Nursing, and School of Education. These details underscore the immense value schools extract from the success of their athletic programs, success that is built upon the work of college athletes, whose NIL rights the schools have colluded to appropriate. Finally, the NCAA will likely attempt to revisit the Ninth Circuit’s decision in O’Bannon, which held that payments to athletes should be “tethered to education.” This provided the support for providing college athletes with an approximately $2,500 to $5,000 “cost-of-attendance” (COA) stipend, a move the NCAA fought. While these COA payments provide a small measure of relief, particularly given evidence that 86 percent of college athletes live below the poverty line, consider this: During this year’s PAC-12 basketball tournament, Commissioner Larry Scott, whose $4.8 million annual salary exceeds that of the Big Ten and SEC Commissioners combined, stayed in a 3,300 square-foot, $7,500 per night suite at the Aria Las Vegas. A few months earlier, during the Alston v. NCAA trial, Scott pontificated about the “purity” of the college game, the same “purity” that pays his salary and lifestyle. This of course, does not even begin to address the racial component of this injustice, a topic that journalist Patrick Hruby explored in his excellent 2016 article “Four Years A Student-Athlete: The Racial Injustice of Big-Time College Sports.” Allowing NIL payments would offer additional education-related benefits. First, for many athletes with uncertain pro futures debating early entry into the professional ranks, NIL payments would allow them to stay in school and finish their degrees without being compelled by financial considerations to make a risky bet. Basketball agents acknowledged this reality in a letter sent to the NCAA this past weekend, explaining that “Every year, men’s basketball student-athletes continue to make poor decisions on whether to remain in the NBA Draft or return to school.” Former Georgetown guard L.J Peak, in Sam Vecenie’s 2017 Vice article, explained how financial considerations led him to leave early and enter his name into the NBA draft, despite expecting to be a second-round pick at best. Allowing NIL payments would benefit fans as well, who often complain about early entry’s effect on roster turnover, a point that addresses the NCAA’s “consumer demand” defense for amateurism. Second, it would relieve many athletes, on whose success their families often depend, from significant stress. In 2015, the University of Mississippi’s Laremy Tunsil, one of the top football players in arguably the nation’s top college football conference, the SEC, was forced to ask coaches for assistance with his mother’s $305 power and water bill. One might wonder if this sum would have covered even a single room service delivery at Larry Scott’s Aria suite. Meanwhile, in the O’Bannon antitrust trial, the NCAA paid one of its economic experts, who argued against compensating athletes for their NIL rights, $2300 per hour. Two hours of this expert’s time in 2013 cost more than an entire year’s COA stipend for an out-of-state football player at Alabama in 2015. While not every athlete could parlay their NIL into a contract with Nike or Coca-Cola, a large number would likely sign smaller endorsement deals with local businesses. The name of an athlete on a little-known product, or perhaps a local doctor’s office or car dealership, can yield financial benefits that can make the difference between struggling financially and being able to remain in school and perhaps help her/his family. Despite its chest-thumping, the NCAA argues against SB206 from a position of legal, economic, and moral weakness. Public opinion, which the NCAA has attempted to sway with its widely-mocked propaganda campaigns, has begun to turn against “amateurism.” Terren Klein, CEO of College Pulse, recently told CNBC’s Make It, “The majority of students are in favor of paying student-athletes and give overwhelming support for allowing student-athletes to profit off their name and image.” And before one casually dismisses college students’ opinions on the matter, the University of Alabama apparently finds their participation important enough to track fourth-quarter early student departures from football games. The NCAA’s threats of a sports apocalypse if athletes were allowed to regain their own identities only expose it as a decrepit and morally bankrupt institution struggling to maintain its economic stranglehold over the lives of young athletes. Thanks to legislators such as Nancy Skinner, Chris Murphy, and others who have taken up the fight for economic justice, the NCAA’s grip has begun to loosen.

San Francisco Media Company,"United States, San Francisco","Mar 5, 2019",Judge rejects Trump administration’s attempt to withhold public safety grants from sanctuary cities,"A federal judge on Monday struck down conditions the Trump administration tried to place on federal law enforcement grants that could have blocked sanctuary cities like San Francisco from receiving the funding. Judge William H. Orrick found unconstitutional conditions the Department of Justice placed on its 2018 public safety grants. The ruling is in line with an earlier decision striking down similar conditions placed on the same types of grants in 2017. One new condition in the 2018 grants was a requirement prohibiting a grant recipient from disclosing information “of any federal law enforcement information in a direct or indirect attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection any fugitive from justice.” The Department of Justice argued the condition was needed after Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf warned immigrants in February 2018 of an imminent raid in the Bay Area by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Orrick’s ruling noted that “The crux of DOJ’s argument relies on an incident where the Oakland’s mayor informed residents of an impending federal immigration operation on social media, allegedly compromising the operation and law enforcement safety.” But Orrick said the proposed non-disclosure condition was too broad and struck it down. City Attorney Dennis Herrera announced the ruling Monday and noted it was his third legal victory against Trump administration attempts to overturn policies protecting immigrants in sanctuary cities. Sanctuary policies restrict local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials. Supporters of sanctuary policies argue cities are safer when immigrants can report crimes to local law enforcement without fear of deportation. “Justice has prevailed once again,” Herrera said in a statement. “These grant conditions were yet another example of presidential overreach, and the court rightly struck them down. This is a victory for the rule of law and common-sense law enforcement. Congress has the power of the purse. The president does not. I suggest this administration stop trying to villainize immigrants and instead read the Constitution.” Monday’s ruling came in a lawsuit filed by San Francisco in U.S. District Court that sought to overturn conditions placed on 2018 law enforcement grants known as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants, which are doled out annually by the Department of Justice. Herrera filed a similar lawsuit over conditions placed on 2017 grants that totaled about $1.4 million, and also prevailed in that case. San Francisco expects to receive the same amount from the 2018 grants. Conditions included requirements that grant recipients allow federal agents access to jails and notify them of the release dates of noncitizens. Orrick’s ruling reiterated findings from the 2017 case, but also addressed the non-disclosure condition. “California and San Francisco agreed at the hearing that the desire to maintain confidentiality is reasonable and that they would not intentionally publicize confidential information concerning impending operations,” Orrick wrote in his March 4 ruling. But, he wrote that “the condition goes well beyond the DOJ’s stated purposes.” “Left to its core—that local jurisdictions should not publicize confidential federal law enforcement actions that are disclosed to local authorities to insure deconfliction and protect local law enforcement and residents—seems self-evident and reasonable,” he wrote. “But DOJ did not leave it to its core, and instead larded it with broad-ranging, ambiguous language that would allow DOJ the discretion to coerce local jurisdictions to comply with its interpretation of the statutes in dispute in these cases.” Herrera also prevailed in a lawsuit filed on Jan. 31, 2017 over President Donald Trump’s executive order to deny federal funding to sanctuary cities. Orrick ruled that the executive order violation the constitution, a ruling that was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 1, 2018.

Happy birthday -- Juan. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Thanks. BAIER: House Speaker Paul Ryan says he will not run for reelection, igniting a battle for his leadership position in raising questions about whether Republicans can survive the midterms. President Trump warns Russia missiles are headed for Syria. And the Kremlin says an airstrike could provoke a super power showdown. Plus more cities are joining the effort to overturn California's sanctuary state law. This is SPECIAL REPORT. Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. The number two spot in line for the presidency will have a new occupant next year. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan says he will not be back after the end of his current term. That has Republicans and Democrats expressing new doubts about whether the GOP can maintain its majority in the House. And it has Ryan's colleagues jockeying for position in the race to replace him. We have Fox team coverage from Capitol Hill tonight. Peter Doocy looks at what Ryan's retirement may mean for the midterms amid a growing roster of Republican incumbents deciding not to run again. But we start off with chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel on an announcement most people, Mike, did not see coming, at least not today. MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Indeed -- Bret, good evening to you. The demands of being House Speaker are huge in terms of fund-raising, travel, and overall stress. Speaker Paul Ryan says he's had enough. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. PAUL RYAN (R), WISCONSIN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Much work remains. But I like to think I have done my part, my little part in history to set us on a better course. EMANUEL: A source familiar says Ryan made the final decision with his wife, Janna, over Easter recess. And that as recently as February Ryan considered running for another term. The Speaker told his staff early this morning and received a standing ovation from his team. Ryan told his Republican colleagues and reporters, family was a key consideration. RYAN: What I realize is if I'm here for one more term, my kids will only have ever known me as a weekend dad. I just can't let that happen. EMANUEL: Ryan also spoke by phone first thing this morning with his House GOP leadership team, Vice President Pence, and President Trump. The President saluted Ryan's service on Twitter, calling Ryan ""a truly good man who will leave an unquestionable legacy of achievement."" Among the challenges for Ryan, a vocal bloc of House conservatives who challenged his leadership, a negotiating partner in the President who at times could be unpredictable. The President threatened to veto a $1.3 trillion pending package that he once embraced. Another frustration was campaigning for years on repealing and replacing Obamacare and the Senate coming up short. The Senate Majority Leader noted Ryan didn't aspire to be Speaker. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Like a true leader, Paul stepped up to the plate. He answered his colleagues' call with exactly the earnest, selfless, and focused approach that has defined his entire career in Congress. EMANUEL: Top Democrats sang his praises too. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Speaker Ryan is a good man. He's always true to his word, even though we disagreed on most issues. In the areas where we could work together, I found him to be smart, thoughtful, and straightforward. I found him to have a great deal of integrity. EMANUEL: Major highlight for the policy wonk was the first tax reform in more than 30 years, and his colleagues say there is still time. REP. MIA LOVE (R), UTAH: I think Paul is going to be anything but a lame duck. I think we are going to be able to get -- get a few more things done while he's here. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: In terms of what's next for the 48-year-old Ryan, sources close to him say he's not going to be having conversations with anyone about that until January -- Bret. BAIER: Mike Emanuel, live on the Hill. Mike -- thanks. Speaker Ryan is known as a prolific fund-raiser and cheerleader obviously for his Republican colleagues. So what will his lame duck status mean for the party entering what many believe will be a very close midterm election? Correspondent Peter Doocy has that part of the story tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: In the early stages of the midterm cycle, Speaker Ryan has been crisscrossing the country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Speaker of the House -- Speaker Paul Ryan. DOOCY: Raising money, convincing donors to write more than $40 million worth of checks to help House Republicans maintain the majority. So why retire? RYAN: I really don't think a person's race for Congress is going to hinge on whether Paul Ryan is speaker or not. So I really don't think it affects it. DOOCY: The National Republican Congressional Committee led by Congressman Steve Stivers is now assessing how Ryan's departure affects its bottom line. REP. STEVE STIVERS (R), OHIO, NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE: I believe his donor base is connected to him and will stick with him even when he's not running for speaker. But, you know, we will see what happens there. DOOCY: In really tight races, incumbents think voters will care more about local issues that an outgoing speaker. REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK: I'm not sure it has that much impact to be perfectly honest with you. My race is so unique to my district. DOOCY: Ryan is one of 26 Republicans retiring from politics; 13 others are leaving to pursue different offices. But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee which has been predicting Ryan would retire thinks he is just getting out because he quote, ""sees what is coming"" in November. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Paul Ryan is bailing; unfortunately for House Republicans, they all are still stuck with his agenda. DOOCY: That agenda may determine which Republican is picked to succeed Ryan. One possibility -- Majority Whip Steve Scalise. REP. STEVE SCALISE (R), LOUISIANA, HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: I think what's most important is that we stay focused on working with President Trump to get our economy back on track and we are doing that. DOOCY: Another possibility -- Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), CALIFORNIA, HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: We've got a lot of work to do and focus on keeping the majority; nothing about a speaker race. DOOCY: That's why Republicans don't see a speaker's race impacting November's contest with one exception. STIVERS: The one place that might have some impact is if people are speculating that Nancy Pelosi might be speaker. It might motivate the base. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY: Democrats insist they've got the motivated base and that if Ryan thought Republicans would still be in the majority this time next year, he wouldn't be leaving. But Republicans believe the retirement is a one-day story -- Bret. BAIER: We will see. Peter, live on the hill. Peter -- thanks. More on this with the panel. Almost four dozen Republicans resigning or retiring from the House, three Republican senators. So what do you think of Ryan's decision? What do you think it will mean potentially for the midterms if anything? Let me know on Twitter @BretBaier and use the #SpecialReport or on Facebook at Facebook.com/BretBaiersr. Now to other stories. The situation between the U.S., Syria and Russia could hardly be more tense tonight. President Trump is threatening or promising to launch air strikes against Syria over alleged chemical attacks on civilians there. Russia, Syria's major ally, says such an attack would be an act of war, inviting a military response. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts tells us what he is hearing from the administration tonight. Good evening -- John. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Bret -- good evening. At this point in time, a military strike against Syria certainly looks likely and all sides are rattling sabers in a way that we haven't seen before. But a couple big questions remain. Was this actually a chemical attack and is there a way to avoid air strikes? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: A military strike against Syria is on a hot boil at the White House but the press secretary Sarah Sanders saying today it may not be inevitable. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: That is certainly one option but that doesn't mean it's the only option. ROBERTS: In a tweet this morning, President Trump suggested a missile strike was imminent, taunting Russia which has threatened to shoot down American missiles over Syria. The President tweeting, ""Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and smart. You shouldn't be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it."" The tweet brought howls of hypocrisy from some corners. Isn't this the same president who trashed President Obama for telegraphing his military intentions? (CROSSTALK) SANDERS: He certainly hasn't laid out the timetable, which would be broadcasting his intentions. ROBERTS: Other critics took aim at the President for not having a cohesive strategy on Syria announcing one week that he wants American troops out and now threatening a military strike. SEN. TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA: I think the President does not have a Syria strategy. And I think one off-attacks or tweets or missile strikes are not the same as a strategy. ROBERTS: The President's national security team including Defense Secretary James Mattis huddled with the Vice President at the White House today to go over options. Mattis saying earlier today that the U.S. is still awaiting confirmation that chemical weapons were in fact used in Douma. JAMES MATTIS, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: We are still assessing the intelligence ourselves and our allies. We are still working on this. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is the U.S. military ready right now to conduct a retaliatory strike in -- MATTIS: We stand ready to provide military options if they are appropriate as the President determined. ROBERTS: Russia continues to deny that chemical weapons were used. A senior military official today saying the attack was staged by rebel emergency responders, the White Helmets. VICTOR POZNIKHIR (PH), RUSSIAN MILITARY SPOKESMAN (through translator): Based on investigating the territory, visiting the medical institutions featured in the footage by the White Helmets, questioning of medical personnel and patients we found no evidence of poisoning substances or victims among residents of this town. ROBERTS: In a series of tweets, President Trump today said, ""Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War."" And he blamed the deterioration on the Mueller investigation tweeting, ""Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the fake and corrupt Russia investigation."" The President is still piqued about the raid on his personal attorney Michael Cohen. Part of what the FBI was looking for was documents related to the infamous Access Hollywood tape. It appears to be an attempt to link the tape to the Stormy Daniels payment. Was Cohen trying to avoid more bad publicity to protect the campaign? Did the payment constitute an illegal political contribution? President Trump incensed that the Mueller investigation may have strayed outside bounds of its initial mandate. SANDERS: The President certainly has been clear that he has a very deep concern about the direction of the special counsel and other investigations have taken. ROBERTS: Is President Trump again considering firing Mueller? He has gone from flat denials to a far more ambiguous posture. Certainly the President's allies are warning against it. SEN. CORY GARDNER (R), COLORADO: I think it would be a mistake -- a grave mistake by the President to fire Robert Mueller. I have no belief that he will. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTS: The Cohen raid may be an attempt to put pressure on Cohen to cooperate with prosecutors, threaten him with campaign finance-related charges in hopes that he will roll over on the President. Certainly, Cohen has a treasure trove of knowledge about President Trump. Flipping the President's personal attorney would mark a dramatic escalation in the momentum of this investigation -- Bret. BAIER: John Roberts, live on the north lawn. John -- thanks. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee has just seen a copy of that FBI memo that began the bureau's probe into allegations of collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Chairman Devin Nunes had set today as the deadline for the FBI to show him that document. Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge is here to tell us what happened today. Good evening -- Catherine. CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well, thank you -- Bret. And good evening. After threatening contempt of Congress, a government source confirms to Fox News that the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes along with Congressman Trey Gowdy as well as committee staffers went to the Justice Department late today and met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and viewed a copy of the two-page FBI memo that kick started the Russia probe. While not a clean copy as lawmakers demanded, the government source told Fox, the redactions were quote, ""minimal and justified"". Based on Fox's reporting, the two-page memo from July 2016 was drafted by or with major input from FBI agent Peter Strzok who was removed from the special counsel Russia case after the discovery of anti-Trump text messages. On Fox last night, Devin Nunes said legal action was warranted after months of delay by the FBI and Justice Department. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: They are not giving this to us. It tells me there's something wrong here. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: What are the chances you're going to hold them in contempt of congress right now? NUNES: Well, I cannot tell you that we are not going to just hold them in contempt. We will have a plan to hold them in contempt and to impeach. INGRAHAM: To impeach Christopher Wray? NUNES: Absolutely. INGRAHAM: Rod Rosenstein? NUNES: We are not messing around here. (END VIDEO CLIP) HERRIDGE: Despite the eleventh-hour resolution, Fox News is told that congressional investigators remain concerned about the memo's underlying intelligence and the credibility of the sources and that it will require further investigation. We asked the FBI for comment and we are waiting to hear back from them. But we did just hear back from the Department of Justice. They said the remaining redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the name of a foreign country as well as the name of a foreign agent -- Bret. BAIER: Catherine -- thank you. HERRIDGE: You're welcome. BAIER: We will monitor that. Breaking news now. The President's pick to become the country's top diplomat says the State Department will find its swagger once again. Current CIA director Mike Pompeo will make that promise and many others during his confirmation hearing tomorrow on Capitol Hill to become the next secretary of state. Correspondent Rich Edson has an exclusive preview from the State Department tonight. Good evening -- Rich. RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening -- Bret. Fox News has obtained excerpts from Director Pompeo's opening remarks from a senior administration official. There is an assumption in Washington that Pompeo's selection means the end of the Iran nuclear agreement. Pompeo says he is still willing to work with European allies to change the policy and keep the U.S. in the deal. He will say quote ""If confirmed, it will be an immediate personal priority to work with those partners to see if such a fix is achievable. The stakes are high for everyone, but especially Tehran."" On the Putin regime, he will say quote, ""Russia continues to act aggressively, enabled by years of soft policy towards that aggression. That is now over. Our diplomatic efforts with Russia will prove challenging but as in previous confrontations with Moscow, must continue."" A source close to Pompeo notes as CIA director he is already in the middle of preparations for President Trump's expected meeting with Kim Jong-un. Pompeo will say quote, ""I have read the CIA histories of previous negotiations with the North Koreans and am confident that we will not repeat the mistakes of the past. President Trump isn't one to play games at the negotiating table and I won't be either. And if charges the he would be a war hawk as secretary, Pompeo will say quote, ""There are few who dread war more than those of us who have served in uniform. I would prefer achieving the President's foreign policy goals with unrelenting diplomacy rather than by sending young men and women to war."" A source close to the CIA director says it's not his intent to criticize Secretary Tillerson, though Tillerson left with a morale problem here of the State Department and the source says Pompeo wants to address the immediate needs, staffing deficiencies, and work with senators in both parties to accomplish. The source says he has spent hundreds of hours here, Pompeo, preparing for this hearing and for the eventual transition if he is confirmed. And that he has even spoken to all living secretaries of state, including Rex Tillerson and Hillary Clinton -- Bret. BAIER: Rich Edson, live at the State Department. Rich -- thank you. Opposition to California's status as a sanctuary state is growing. The list of communities within that state going up against the law continues to expand. Senior correspondent Adam Housley shows us tonight from Los Angeles. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: God bless Donald Trump. ADAM HOUSLEY, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Slivers of red in one of the country's bluest states as two more cities, Newport Beach and Orange, decided to join President Trump in opposition to the California so-called sanctuary state law SB 54. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to see our border secure. I want to see a wall. And I want to see all illegal aliens systematically and aggressively removed from our country. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I encourage the council not to pass this resolution. I don't think it's necessary to take this stance at this point. HOUSLEY: The sixth most populous county in the United States in one of the last bastions of conservatism in the Golden State, Orange County has squarely sided with President Trump as the county and now nine cities starting with Los Alamitos last month openly oppose SB 54 -- California's law that limits state and local police cooperation with federal immigration authorities while the sheriff's office has decided to opt out of following the law altogether. The public battle is as heated as the legal one with civic debate extended for hours. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am very offended because I work very hard to be in America. And here we are protecting illegal criminals. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Of contention here is that we want to protect the immigrants that are right now afraid to report crimes, to go to school. Our community, our neighbors are afraid to walk the streets of Orange. (END VIDEOTAPE) HOUSLEY: Also in California, the Trump administration arguing today that the President's executive order of threatening to cut funding from cities and states who won't cooperate with immigration authorities is legal. It's an appeal to a previous judge's ruling that blocked the order nationwide heard by a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit -- Bret. BAIER: Adam Housley in Los Angeles. Adam -- thank you. Several people in the counterterrorism community are calling Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg a liar. We will tell you why when we come back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: President Trump says he's making progress with China over its trade policies. That was part of a Twitter posting from the President this morning. ""So much fake news about what is going on in the White House,"" he tweeted. ""Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China, the coming North Korea meeting and, of course, the vicious gas attack in Syria. Feels great to have (national security advisor) John Bolton and (National Economic Council director) Larry Kudlow on board. I, we, are doing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never-ending and corrupt Russia investigation, which takes tremendous time and focus. No collusion or obstruction other than I fight back, so now they do the unthinkable and raid a lawyer's office for information. Bad."" Stocks were down today. The Dow lost 219. The S&P 500 fell 15. The Nasdaq dropped 25. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says there will be some regulation of Internet firms. Zuckerberg made that prediction during testimony today before House lawmakers -- his second straight day of answering questions from Congress. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: The Internet is growing in importance around the world, in people's lives. And I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation. So my position is not that there should be no regulation but I also think that you have to be careful about what regulation you put in place. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Some on the counterterrorism community are calling Zuckerberg a liar tonight. They say his statements about cleaning up extremism from the social media site are just not true. Correspondent Gillian Turner looks at the allegations tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZUCKERBERG: 99 percent of the ISIS and al Qaeda content that we take down on Facebook are AI systems flagged before any human sees it. GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Mark Zuckerberg may have said all the right things this week in his testimony about Facebook's push to eradicate terrorist content from its platform but the counterterrorism community says it's not true. Facebook is failing when it comes to combating terrorism. TARA MALLER, COUNTER EXTREMISIM PROJECT: We're not actually seeing that translate into the reduction of terrorist content on these platforms. We are not actually seeing ISIS bomb-making videos permanently removed. TURNER: And Congress is piling on; one lawmaker citing two instances from the past ten days alone. REP. SUSAN BROOKS (R), INDIANA: ISIS content was discovered on Facebook which included an execution video, March 29. On April 9, there were five pages located on April 9th of Hezbollah content. TURNER: A big part of the problem, according to terrorism expert is that Facebook officials are still relying on its users to report terrorist activity and content when they should be policing the platform themselves. MALLER: On the scale that they have now, they can't just sit back and let users report problematic content. If you're using that as a standard, you're never going to even make a small blip on the radar screen in terms of what's happening on this platforms. TURNER: Other experts caution that Facebook may never get this problem fully under control. STEVEN BUCCI, CYBER SECURITY EXPERT: You're talking about massive, massive amount of data, even more than the intel community normally deals with on a day-to-day basis. It's a herculean task to think that they are going to be able to cull through all that information and find the bad guys other than the ones who are really, really obvious about it. (END VIDEOTAPE) TURNER: Zuckerberg told lawmakers today a new beefed-up counterterrorism team of 200 people inside Facebook is the answer. But the real Holy Grail for Facebook and other social media companies when it comes to controlling access to their platforms is more advanced artificial intelligence something Zuckerberg says is currently in development -- Bret. BAIER: Gillian -- thank you. California Democrat Governor Jerry Brown has agreed to deploy 400 National Guard troops at President Trump's request but not all will head to the U.S.-Mexico border as the President wants and none will enforce federal immigration law, according to the governor. Brown says the mission will not include building a wall or rounding up illegal immigrants. President Trump wants up to 4,000 National Guard troops sent to the border to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking and has already won commitments without disclaimers for about 1,600 from Republican governors of other states that border Mexico -- Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Up next congressional Republicans have buyer's remorse over tax cuts and spending. First here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. WDRB In Louisville as Kentucky's Democratic attorney general and unions representing teachers and police officers sue to block a bill that would make changes to one of the countries worst funded public pension systems. Republican Governor Matt Bevin signed the bill into law yesterday. Thousands of teachers have protested that measure with marches at the state capitol -- part of ongoing demonstrations across the country. Fox 32 in Chicago as an aviation security officer fired after forcibly dragging a passenger from a plane last year files a lawsuit against United Airlines and the city of Chicago. James Long was one of the officers called to a plane after a man refused to give up his seat. Video taken by other passenger shows Long dragging the passenger from the plane. Long was fired in August. And this is a live look in Salt Lake City from our affiliate Fox 13 out there. One of big stories there tonight, Mitt Romney has gathered enough signatures to qualify for the ballot in the U.S. Senate race, but which ballot that is, remains to be seen. Depending on what happens at next week's Utah Republican Party state convention Romney will either face a primary election or B, the party's nominee in November. That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Tonight congressional Republicans are trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube essentially. After going along with the President's tax cuts and a huge spending bill, many are now looking for a way to turn back the clock and reduce what could be historic deficit numbers. Correspondent Doug McKelway tells us what they are up against. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. BOB CORKER (R), TENNESSEE: This Congress and this administration likely will go down as one of the most fiscally irresponsible administrations and Congress that we have had. DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That confession today after the Congressional Budget Office chief said that the recently passed tax bill and spending bill combined will cost deficits to grow by $4 trillion over the next 10 years. Corker is not the only one flummoxed by the one-two punch of that forecast. The president's new economic chief this week is sending Congress a package to trim back what it budgeted last month. LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: We are looking at an enhanced rescission package. I think the Republican Party on the Hill has finally figured out. MCKELWAY: He's right. House conservatives fresh from an Easter scolding by constituents for what they consider to be reckless spending will vote tomorrow on a balanced budget amendment. But a two-thirds majority is required and Democrats won't bite. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), CALIFORNIA, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: They go forward and call this so-called balanced budget amendment, it's not balanced and it should not be an amendment to the constitution. The CBO did acknowledge the tax cuts have helped stimulate the economy. The treasury secretary believes there is more to come. STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: We are really just beginning to see the important economic aspects of that. MCKELWAY: But neither party appears capable taking responsibility for outlays that outpace revenues. The single biggest cause of it, the aging of America and resulted entitlements, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. SEN. MIKE ENZI (R), WYOMING, SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: You said that I said cut Medicare and Social Security. I have never said cut them. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: If I misquoted you, then I am sorry. But some of your colleagues especially in the House have talked about cuts to Social Security and Medicare. MCKELWAY: Speaker Paul Ryan is one of the few who has attempted reforming entitlements, and he is leaving soon. And now a new deficit threat may emerge, a long feared rise in interest rates. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just the net interest payments is going to triple over the next 10 years. That's bigger than all of defense spending. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCKELWAY: The good news is while critics scoffed when the Trump administration claimed it could achieve three percent growth in the economy, in fact it did so for three quarters in a row. Bret? BAIER: Doug, thank you. Former House Speaker John Boehner says he has had a change of heart on marijuana and will now promote its nationwide legalization. Boehner has joined the advisory board of Acreage Holdings, a multistate cannabis company. He says he believes legalizing marijuana can be helpful to the nation's veterans. He wants to allow the Veterans Affairs Department to offer marijuana as a treatment option. A strange situation tonight in the Colorado governor's race, questions about the validity of voters' signatures used to get on the ballot for the Republican side of the ticket. Correspondent Alicia Acuna has detail tonight from Denver. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALICIA ACUNA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The announcement hit the Colorado governor's race like a political earthquake. WALKER STAPLETON, (R) COLORADO GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: In good conscience I cannot be put on the ballot in this manner, and I will not. ACUNA: The GOP frontrunner Walker Stapleton says the petition to place him on the June primary ballot is fraudulent, and the firm he paid $200,000 to gather signatures is responsible. Under Colorado law petition circulators must be legal state residents. The lawsuit questions signatures gathered by a person named Daniel Alejandro Velasquez. Kennedy Enterprises, the firm hired by the Stapleton campaign, said there was no such person. Turns out he worked there. STAPLETON: The existence of this person changes everything because it means that Mr. Kennedy comported himself in an unethical manner, and in so doing put in jeopardy Colorado's process and integrity of how we run elections. ACUNA: CEO Dan Kennedy said he investigated claims of wrongdoing and alerted the campaign, insisting he did not lie to his clients or the state, adding, quote, ""the best of my knowledge, the signatures collected on the Stapleton campaign were all collected lawfully."" STAPLETON: Hi, I'm Walker Stapleton. ACUNA: Stapleton, a two-term state treasurer, leads the GOP pack in both fundraising and polling. Fellow Republican candidate Doug Robinson's campaign, which brought the case to light, said it strains credulity to believe that no one on Walker's team was aware of these abuses. (END VIDEOTAPE) ACUNA: Stapleton says he is staying in the race and will court delegates this weekend at the Colorado GOP assembly. Bret? BAIER: We'll follow that one. Alicia, thank you. Up next, the panel on House Speaker Paul Ryan's decision to retire after his current term and what that may mean for Republicans in the fall. First, beyond our borders tonight. An Algerian military plane carrying soldiers, their families, and some refugees crashed soon after takeoff today in a field in northern Algeria. And 257 people were killed in what appears to be the North African nation's worst ever aviation disaster. At least four men were killed in Kashmir when government forces fired on anti-India protesters who jammed a village where soldiers battled a group of militants there. One soldier was also killed. Separatists have called for a shutdown of the region on Thursday and Friday to denounce those killings. And a court in Burma is refusing to dismiss a case against two Reuters journalists accused of illegally acquiring secret government papers. Last week the reporters' lawyers insisted the evidence does not support the charges. The U.S., Britain, and Canada as well as the United Nations have called for those reporters to be freed. Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) REP. PAUL RYAN (R), WISCONSIN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Today I am announcing that this year will be my last one is a member of the House. To be clear, I am not resigning. I intend to full my serve term as I was elected to do. But I will be retiring in January. You all know that I did not seek this job. I took it reluctantly. But I have given this job everything that I have. And I have no regrets whatsoever for having accepted this responsibility. The truth is, it's easy for it to take over everything in your life. I just don't want to be one of those people looking back on my life thinking I spend more time with my kids when I know if I spend another term, they will only know me as a weekend father. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Speaker Paul Ryan saying he will not seek reelection. The president tweeting out soon after that announcement, ""Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking reelection he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!"" The president is actually with Paul Ryan currently. He's having dinner at the White House along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, and Senator John Cornyn. As far as possible replacements when the speaker does step down, you've got Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise who are kind of jockeying out for position possibly to be the next speaker or, if Republicans lose, the next minority leader. Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the ""Washington Examiner,"" A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics and host of ""No Labels Radio"" on Sirius XM, and Eli Lake, columnist for ""Bloomberg View."" A.B., a lot of people were surprised by today the announcement but maybe not surprised that he was going to make this move eventually. A.B. STODDARD, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: I think a lot of Republicans, we didn't expect him to be speaker again. I think a lot of Republicans assumed that Paul Ryan was going to run for his seat, wake up the morning after Election Day, count the losses, and quit. And that would be the cheap thing to do and it's just not like Paul Ryan and he couldn't stomach doing that. His district really comes first. The kid thing is real. Actually wanting to be with his children who have never known him living at home fulltime is real. But that said, I cannot - - his fealty to what was the Republican Party really cannot be overstated. He really wants to put everything into an effort to mitigate the losses to the House Republican majority this fall. He will not be untethered and he will not be liberated. He will not be criticizing the president. He will do everything he can until the last hour to try to make sure they hold the House and keep the losses to a minimum. BAIER: And Byron, it is as of tonight seeming like it is more of an uphill battle to do that, to hold on to the House. You have 26 retirements, 13 running for other office, three seats are vacant. So now you are at 41 Republicans, including now the speaker not running for reelection. And the Democrats need to pick up 25. So it's getting tougher. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, ""WASHINGTON EXAMINER"": This is not the sign of a party that's working well or working smoothly. And even if you put the president's troubles aside in his relatively low approval ratings, just the historical trends are terrible for Republicans. Bill Clinton lost 54 seats in his first midterm. Barack Obama lost 63 seats in his first midterm. It didn't happen to George W. Bush because of September 11th. This is not looking good for Republicans now. And the other thing is in the course of less than three years, two Republican speakers of the house have just bailed. They just up and quit. John Boehner did it in late 2015. That's how we got Paul Ryan, the speaker. And I think that speaks to the fact that it is very difficult to control the faction-ridden House of Representatives GOP caucus. You've got the Freedom Caucus. You've got the Tuesday group. You've got a bunch people. You don't have a huge majority, and it's tough to get to get 218 votes out of them. BAIER: Yes, tough to heard the cats. Eli? ELI LAKE, COLUMNIST, ""BLOOMBERG VIEW"": I think that you look at the election of Trump and then to this date, and you are saying that's the arc of the transformation of the Republican party. Paul Ryan is an emblem of a Republican Party that was against deficits, was for lower taxes, was -- certainly, there's always a popular appeal but is not the same kind of populist as Trump. And now the GOP is really Trump's party. And that is I think a significant thing when we take a step back and widen the aperture. BAIER: Let's listen to the speaker and the majority and minority leader on upcoming months what could come. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PAUL RYAN (R), WISCONSIN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE : I want to be clear. I'm not done yet. I intend to run for the tape, to finish the year. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: If he is willing to reach across the aisle, he'll find Democrats willing and eager to work with him. I say to speaker Ryan, let's work together. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY: I look forward to collaborating closely these next months to implement more of the inclusive pro-growth, pro-opportunity agenda the American people are counting on us to keep advancing. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: They put it in speeches, A.B., but let's be real. What is going to happen between now and November legislatively on Capitol Hill? STODDARD: Nothing. And they know that. Again, I want to return to my first point. He's not going to do anything in his final months that would potentially -- everything will be seen through the prism of what will depress Republican turnout in the midterms, and that is a real fear. YORK: Liberated to distance himself from Trump as his instinct has been at times? STODDARD: I actually don't think so because he's going to do everything he can to try to help the Republicans hold on to the House. As for some bipartisan immigration legislation that he once would have championed, I also think that is going to be seen through the prism of what will depress Republican turnout in the midterms. They are talking about a rescission package. Give me a break. To take back the spending that was just the Democratic spending in the last omnibus that Trump threatened to veto in the last hour, I don't see that happening either. BAIER: Here's an interesting poll, though. Quinnipiac had a poll out today that maybe tells a different story than what we are seeing with these Republican retirements, and that is who deserves credit for the state of the economy, which by all accounts is doing pretty well. President Trump gets 55 percent of women, there you 49 percent, 46 percent of Democrats that President Trump gets the credit for the state of the economy. If by the time you get to November, Byron, and the state of the economy is still cooking, could this potential wave of Democratic wins in the House maybe not materialized as many people think? YORK: The only reason to be really cautious and modest about talking about this blue wave that's maybe coming in November is what happened in 2016. The fact that Donald Trump won the White House on a day in which his personal disapproval rating was 60 percent. So if, in fact, things don't operate the way they used to do, perhaps that's a real possibility. But the numbers I was talking about, the historical numbers, the losses with presidents in their first midterm, they really are real. And barring some big event that we don't know about yet, it seems hard to imagine that they wouldn't happen again. BAIER: And last word on the jockeying for position. Is it Kevin McCarthy's to kind of position or is Scalise in the game here to do you think? LAKE: I think it depends on the perception at this point about how bad that loss is going to be in the midterms. And I think, remember, Kevin McCarthy had a chance to run, and he declined to do it the first time around which paved the way for Ryan. And I would imagine that at this point even though he has the inside track, Scalise probably has the wind at his back so to speak. BAIER: Do you buy that? STODDARD: They don't know what this leadership ejection is going to look like until they wake up the day after the election and people start doing a blame game. Blame Trump, blame the tariffs, blame this, blame that. They have no idea. So they are going to run the race privately in the months to come, but it's going to be a different race after November. BAIER: Yes, and we'll be cautious here because there is a long way to go before November. Next up, harsh words and threats between the U.S., Russia, and Syria. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Certainly there are things that are being assessed. I can't get into the details but we are confident in the part of this process that we are in to feel comfortable making the assertions that we have. JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY: We are still assessing the intelligence ourselves and our allies. We're still working on this. We stand ready to provide military options if they are appropriate, as the president determined. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, the going bet here in Washington is that there will be some kind of action, some kind of U.S. military action, how extensive it is, when it happens, what exactly it looks like, all variables. But two tweets today really caught everybody's eyes and raised some eyebrows at the Pentagon, I think. The president saying ""Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and ""smart!"" You shouldn't be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it!"" ""Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?"" We will start there with the panel. Eli, that was an eye-opener when those tweets came out. LAKE: It's a little weird because there isn't much of an arms race with Russia. It's a different kind of problem in the sense that the Russians are an outlaw in every sense of the word and that includes supporting Assad who if he hasn't gassed this time has gassed before. My concern is that we are focusing on those straight, the response. The real question that Trump has not answered at this point and is sort of hanging out there is that, will the United States protect the people that it liberated from ISIS in eastern Syria going forward? Or will it -- BAIER: A no fly zone or some kind of protection. LAKE: Right. And these were, in a lot of cases, mainly Kurds who have fought them over there so we don't have to fight them over here. So in that respect, I think my view is we would be incredibly foolish to just leave them to their mercies of Iran, Russia, and Bashar al-Assad. But that's the big question. The air strike is important, but that is much more important. BAIER: Russian foreign ministry spokesman responded saying ""Smart missiles must fly towards terrorist, not a legitimate government that has been fighting international terrorism in its territory for several years."" Putin's spokesperson responded saying ""We are not participating in Twitter diplomacy. We are supporting series approaches. We still firmly believe that it's important to abstain from taking steps which may be detrimental to the already fragile situation in Syria."" Others threatened that there would be military retaliation, A.B. STODDARD: As usual, this has happened before. There is a pronouncement from Trump in the form today of a schoolyard taunt and threat that does not represent an actual decision on policy, and everyone in the administration at the highest levels is scrambling to assemble an actual policy. There isn't a policy. The Russians might appreciate this sort of heads up anyway. it gives them and Assad time to sort of mitigate the damage. It will be a targeted strike, they assume. They know there is no regime change in the works, that U.S. policy towards Syria is basically tolerance. And so it's just reckless. I don't think the president appreciates how complicated, how gravely complicated this is and how quickly these situations can escalate. And I think if he did he wouldn't have sent those tweets this morning. BAIER: White House briefing today peppered, the press secretary peppered with questions about these tweets. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president was direct and talking about missiles, to get ready, Russia because they will be coming, nice and new and smart. Why is the president telegraphing his military intentions on Twitter, announcing effectively an attack on Twitter? SANDERS: The president has not laid out a timetable and is still leaving a number of other options on the table. And we are still considering a number of those and a final decision on that front hasn't been made. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Byron? YORK: There have been a lot of questions about how does this tweet reconcile with the things Trump said in the campaign about not revealing U.S. intentions. And I think the answer is it doesn't. He said one thing and now he's doing a different thing. But I think it's really important in this case if there is to be an attack that the U.S. government explain what we know about this chemical attack in Syria. BAIER: In other words, show or talk about the intelligence. YORK: Make the case. Last time in April, I believe, April of 2017, the chemical weapons attack was on April 4. U.S. missiles go April 7th. We have already waited longer than that gap there. But it seems to me that before we do something, it would be a good idea for the White House, obviously confident of its case, you can sell president that laid it directly to Assad, but just make the case before they do it. BAIER: I think the State Department is trying to or starting to. Heather Nauert tweeting out ""The Assad regime's history of chemical weapons use not in dispute. It's actions as a signatory to the chemical weapons convention are an egregious violation. Russia's denials and other obstructionist actions call into question it's own commitment to non-proliferation, #Syria."" ""Reports from contacts in the ground in Douma are credible and will be investigated by the independent fact-finding mission. This was a barbaric attack and the international community must hold any party that uses chemical weapons accountable. We will stand up for the people of Syria."" So I think that's part of that effort to lay out that case. LAKE: It's also one party in the conflict has chemical weapons that we know about, and it still hasn't been proven despite a lot of things on the Internet that the rebels have access to these chemical weapons. And once we start assuming that -- we know there was a chemical gas attack. We don't know for sure, I guess we are saying is we would like to see the evidence it was from Assad, but it's much harder to believe using the razor of Occam that it was the rebels themselves in their final redoubt gassing themselves to get more attention when as A.B. pointed out, the policy is not regime change at this point. So I think he did this because the signal was that Trump said we are leaving and the message the Syrian people is I can do whatever I want. And that's just looking at that, of course we should await the evidence, but -- BAIER: Yes or no, does it happen over the next couple days? LAKE: I think it will. STODDARD: I do too. YORK: Yes. BAIER: If it does we have you covered here on FOX News Channel. We have complete coverage from the Middle East and obviously here in Washington, all aspects of this. It's been a busy couple of days. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That is it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid. ""The Story"" hosted by my friend Martha MacCallum who is in D.C. here tonight will start after a short break. She will actually be in this very set, so we are going to get out of the way.

He can also sue a member of the university hearing panel (who served as investigator, prosecutor, and judge) for failing to act as a neutral arbiter by, for instance, claiming at the hearing that ""I'll bet you do this all the time"" and withholding the report detailing the evidence against him. * Allegation: Officer orders Clarkston, Mich. pedestrian suspected of being suspicious to stop. The man continues walking and then runs after he's told he'll be cuffed. Thinking he made good his escape, the man lies down in a backyard; the officer catches up, punches him 15 to 20 times in the head. Sixth Circuit (over a dissent): Despite pleading guilty to pot possession and resisting arrest, the man can sue the officer for using excessive force. * Toddler plays on stanchion in Chicago coffee shop while his parents focus their attention elsewhere. It upends; his finger must be amputated. Was the shop at fault? The Seventh Circuit says no; the parents' presence abrogated any duty of care Starbucks may have owed the child. * Allegation: St. Louis SWAT team raids home. An hour later, a city building inspector demands that a resident, who is still cuffed, sign a consent-to-search form—or his family will be put out on the street and the home condemned. District court: The family can't sue the police. But they can sue the inspector and the city. Eighth Circuit: The family can't sue the inspector. * A San Francisco law forbidding landlords from converting their rental properties into condos for 10 years, if they buy out two or more tenants in the same building first, satisfies rational basis review, says the Ninth Circuit. * Jury: Tulsa, Okla. jail officer sexually assaulted underage inmate numerous times over several months. Tenth Circuit: The sheriff, by choosing to hold female juveniles in adult jail in an isolated area (in 23-hour a day confinement) with no surveillance cameras and often just one guard on duty, was deliberately indifferent to the risk. No need to reconsider the jury's $25k award. * In wake of fatal Tulsa, Okla. police shooting, man posts messages to the police department's online complaint form asserting that officers and their families will be killed. Tenth Circuit: The messages were true threats and so not protected by the First Amendment. * Displeased that flight attendants have ceased serving him alcohol and have asked him to stop touching them, passenger yells abuse, profanities for an hour and a half. He's convicted of intimidating flight attendants. Does the law violate his free speech rights? It does not, says the Tenth Circuit. * To subdue agitated inmate in Draper, Utah prison recreation yard, officers drop tear gas. Yikes! The prison's ventilation intake is in the yard; gas gets pumped into the prison. Tenth Circuit: Qualified immunity. * Tennessee state forensic scientists have a financial incentive to secure DUI convictions, says a Tennessee appeals court, as the $250 fee imposed on guilty motorists pays their salaries (and some of their positions were nearly cut in a recent budget crunch). Which violates due process. * Former Florida felons who wish to have their voting rights restored must apply to a state board, which has unfettered discretion to reinstate them—or not. Plaintiffs: There is some evidence the board looks more favorably on white applicants and applicants who espouse conservative political views. District court: The state can permanently ban felons from voting, but if it allows for re-enfranchisement, the First Amendment says the restoration process can't be arbitrary (see, among other things, Citizens United). (H/t: Garrett Epps.) In 2016, South Carolina legislators banned online eye exams, a safe and salutary innovation that makes obtaining prescriptions for corrective lenses more convenient and affordable. Written by lobbyists for optometrists, the law is not intended to protect the public; rather it's meant to protect optometrists from competition—which violates the state's constitution. So Opternative, an internet startup, teamed up with IJ to challenge the law. Last month, however, a state trial court ruled that the law—which was specifically enacted to outlaw Opternative—does not harm the company, and so the suit cannot proceed. We will appeal.

POLITICO LLC,"United States, Arlington","Jul 12, 2019",The Trump Bill of Rights,"President Donald Trump came close to rewriting the First Amendment while speaking to the kennel’s worth of right-wing lapdogs, trolls, conspiracy theorists and media hackers he convened at the White House on Thursday for his “Social Media Summit.”
Saying that Google, Facebook and Twitter were guilty of “discriminating against conservatives,” Trump vowed that “all regulatory and legislative solutions” available to the federal government would be used against the companies “to protect free speech.”
Rather than defining free speech in positive terms, Trump explained what free speech isn’t. “To me free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposefully write bad,” Trump said. “To me that’s very dangerous speech and you become angry at it. But that’s not free speech.”
If Trump thinks negative and critical commentary don’t qualify as free speech because they’re “dangerous” and make him “angry,” he’s reversed the First Amendment, which was designed to protect the right to say bad things about “good” things. It’s easy to imagine that Trump’s complete revision of the First Amendment would define freedom of religion as the right to attend a church of Trump’s choice, that the right to assembly was reserved only for people attending MAGA rallies, and that the freedom of the press belongs to those who praise Trump.
Following Trump’s idea to its logical extremes, what would the Bill of Rights look like if he applied the same judicial oomph to the other original amendments to the Constitution? Rewriting the Second Amendment to Trump's satisfaction could be done with just a few word changes. Rather than having a right to bear arms, the Trump rewrite would make gun ownership a duty. This isn’t far from Trump’s real-life position. In a June interview, he all but called for universal armament when he said that unarmed civilians were “sitting ducks.”
The Third Amendment, which forbids the military from using citizens’ homes as crash pads without consent, is the least controversial of all the amendments. Trump, who worships the military, could own the libs with a rewrite stating that the soldiers working on the Mexican border must lodge in nearby private residences. Homeowners who find themselves overcrowded by their military lodgers would be allowed to temporarily reside in our luxurious and spacious migrant detention centers.
Given the fury he directed at special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI for their investigations, I imagine that Trump would fork the Fourth Amendment into a two-parter. His enemies would have no protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. If you haven’t done anything wrong, you have nothing to hide. But searches directed against obviously innocent people like Trump and his associates would be forbidden. Remember his wailing in April 2018, after the FBI served a lawful search warrant on his then-attorney, Michael Cohen? Trump characterized the search, which helped secure a guilty plea from Cohen, as worse than a break-in. “It's an attack on our country,” Trump said. “It’s an attack on what we all stand for.”
Trump’s Fifth Amendment makeover would likely toss the “takings” clause. He's a long-term abuser of eminent domain; he believes that property owners have no right to keep their homes and businesses when he wants to buy them. But what to do about the right against self-incrimination enshrined in the amendment? Keep it as is? Maybe the best way out would be to privatize self-incrimination rights by allowing individuals to sign binding nondisclosure agreements with themselves.
The Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial would be reversed, informed by Trump’s history of dragging his feet in civil cases. Trump loves to sue, and because he’s such a deadbeat, his contractors tend to sue him back. The way Trump sees it, the longer the litigation, the greater chance his opponent will back down. In the famous Tesoro case, Trump’s attorney told architect Andrew Tesoro that he might win the lawsuit he had filed against Trump, but the mogul would make certain the case would last so long that he’d go bankrupt in the process.
The Seventh Amendment, which guarantees civil jury trials in federal court, would probably attract no interest from Trump. But the Eighth, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment would be trash-canned. He’s a proponent of torture, water boarding and other methods of “enhanced interrogation,” saying it “works.” In 1989, he called for the death penalty after a group of teenagers was charged with a Central Park rape. (The teenagers were later exonerated.)
I will leave Trumpian reformation of the Ninth Amendment, which Judge Robert Bork once compared to an impenetrable “inkblot,” to legal scholars. The Ninth might be the only Bill of Rights amendment in dire need of actual freshening, Trump or no Trump. It’s unlikely that Trump would take issue with the Tenth, which establishes the concept of federalism. So instead of rewriting the last two amendments, the unshackled Trump would probably award himself the wild card of an additional amendment to the Bill of Rights. Its wording: “If an incumbent president loses office in a reelection campaign, he shall not be removed from the White House without his consent.”

WP Company LLC d/b/a The Washington Post,"United States, Washington, D.C.","Jun 1, 2017",Md. gerrymandering lawsuit could impact 2018 voting map: The plaintiffs' attorneys have asked a federal court to quickly declare the existing map unconstitutional or bar state officials from enforcing it for the 2018 election.,"Seven individuals challenging Maryland's 6th Congressional District as unconstitutional are asking a federal court to overturn the state's voting map or block officials from using it in the 2018 election.
John Benisek, a resident of Williamsport, and other residents allege that gerrymandering by Maryland Democrats during the 2010-2011 redistricting process violated their First Amendment rights, diminishing the ability of Republicans to elect candidates of their choice for the congressional seat now held by Rep. John Delaney (D).
Plaintiffs' attorneys deposed some of the state's leading Democrats, including former governor Martin O'Malley, who said he felt a responsibility to make the seat more winnable for Democrats. The seat was held at the time by Roscoe Bartlett (R), and O'Malley led the redistricting effort.
On Wednesday, the attorneys filed a motion asking a three-judge panel with the U.S. District Court in Maryland to declare the map unconstitutional or issue a preliminary injunction blocking the state from enforcing it, arguing that ""any further delay risks irreparable injury with respect to the forthcoming 2018 election.""
The plaintiffs are arguing that Democratic state officials who designed the district relied heavily on advanced mapping software, voter-registration data and voting history to give an advantage to their party.
When asked whether he thought the revised district would help Democrats, O'Malley said in his deposition that it ""was certainly my hope, and it was part of my intent.""
O'Malley said state legislative leaders who took part in the redistricting process, including House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert), had the same intentions.
But Miller and Busch, in their depositions, said they did not seek to flip the district to the Democratic column. ""I voted for and supported what I would believe was in the best interest of the citizens of the state,"" Busch said.
Miller and Busch said they were largely unfamiliar with the data given to their staffs during the redistricting process, including metrics showing the chances of Democrats winning districts under various configurations.
""I didn't even review it,"" Miller said. ""It wasn't important to me.""
In redrawing the 6th Congressional District, state officials moved more than 360,000 residents out of the district and a roughly equal number of people into it.
Before the change, Republicans made up nearly 47 percent of registered eligible voters within the boundaries, compared with about 36 percent for Democrats. After the new lines were enacted, Republicans made up 33 percent of registered eligible voters in the district, compared with 44 percent for Democrats.
The Cook Political Report's partisan voter index, which estimates the propensity for districts to vote Democratic or Republican, showed that the 6th Congressional District flipped from an R+13 in 2010 to a D+2 in 2011, the largest swing in the nation that year.
""There is no plausible explanation for the wholesale geographic, demographic, and political reshuffling of the Sixth District other than the attempt to dilute Republican votes to make it impossible for them to reelect Roscoe Bartlett,"" the plaintiffs' attorneys said.
Bartlett, who had consistently won reelection in the district by double-digit margins over two decades, lost the 2012 election to Delaney.
The result gave Democrats seven of Maryland's eight congressional seats. They previously controlled six.
The plaintiffs' attorneys claim that many constituents in and around the 6th District have been ""chilled from participating in the political process, not only because they feel that voting is a lost cause in light of gerrymandering, but also because they feel disconnected from their congressional district.""
During the depositions, Miller was asked about talking points his staff had provided for various speaking engagements at Democratic events. One of the items said the revised 6th District ""gives Democrats a real opportunity to pick up a seventh seat in the delegation by targeting Roscoe Bartlett.""
Another memo said: ""If asked about redistricting, keep it simple. We're going to do our best to help Democrats, while following all of the applicable federal and state constitutional and statutory requirements.""
Miller played down the talking points, saying he generally speaks off the cuff during speeches. He described the notes as ""political rhetoric"" designed to inspire Democrats and not necessarily guiding principles for the redistricting process.
The case is Benisek v. Lamone.

CQ Roll Call,"United States, Atlanta","Feb 6, 2017","Interview With Kellyanne Conway; A Visit to the Border; Confrontation With Iran, U.S. Tensions with Iran Examined; President Trump Criticizes Media; Super Bowl Reviewed","(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
SEAN HANNITY, HOST (voice-over): Tonight. The legal battle over President Trump's temporary travel ban continues. Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway is here with reaction.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The border is soft and weak. Drugs are pouring in. And I'm not going to let that happen.
HANNITY: Then, our ""Hannity"" producers did a ride-long the Border Patrol to see how bad things really are today on our southern border. Geraldo Rivera weighs in.
TRUMP: The men and women of the United States military -- they're the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the earth.
HANNITY: And President Trump outlines his vision for America's military, and also the looming showdown ratcheting up with Iran. We'll check in with Colonel Oliver North and he'll react.
TRUMP: Much of the media, not all of it, is very, very dishonest.
HANNITY: Plus, President Trump fights back against endless smears from the abusively biased press. Larry Elder, Mercedes Schlapp respond,
""Hannity"" starts right here, right now.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: And welcome to ""Hannity."" A fierce legal battle is brewing over President Donald Trump's extreme vetting executive order as liberals and the left continue to be willing to gamble with the lives of you, the American people. And that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue.""
So the legal back and forth is complete and total nonsense because we shouldn't even be at this point in the first place. And here's why. Now, this is a classic example of activist judges ruling based on their own personal opinions and not on what the law actually says -- judicial activism -- because if you look at the U.S. code that pertains to President Trump's executive action -- let me put it up on the screen.
It reads, quote, "" Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the U.S. would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants, non-immigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions that he may deem to be appropriate.""
Now, Daniel Horowitz, our friend over at Conservative Review -- he wrote an article entitled ""Rogue judges undermining our sovereignty, and here's how Congress can stop them."" Now, in it, Horowitz argues that the judiciary branch of our governor, especially on the lower levels, has been utterly polluted by progressive judges who decide rulings that are based on personal or political opinions, not on the law, not on standing, not on the Constitution.
So in other words, a lawsuit can be brought before a liberal judge -- they can go judge shopping -- or in a liberal-leaning court, and it can have a national impact, like what we are seeing playing out. Now, according to Horowitz, Congress should work to take back their power from these activist courts in order to protect you, the American people, our sovereignty and the rule of law.
Now, for example, the U.S. 9th circuit court of appeals, where this legal battle is now playing out, is known by all to be the most liberal federal appeals court in the country. And if you look at the Seattle-based federal judge, James Robart, who put a temporary halt to the president's extreme vetting executive order on Friday, well, he has a history of questionable rulings. And according to The Seattle Times, during a hearing last year on police reform, well, Judge Robart -- he declared, quote, ""black lives matter, and of course, all lives matter.""
And then there is the out-of-control liberal hypocrisy that is on full display here. For example, Senator Chuck Schumer -- he's calling foul over the president's executive order, but what the Senator is not telling you, that back in 2015, he actually said a pause on admitting refugees into the country could be necessary.
Then there's the two most recent Democratic presidents. They argued in favor of tougher immigration laws. Let's take a look at Bill Clinton. This was back in 1995 during a State of the Union address. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BILL CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All Americans, not only in the state's most heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.
We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Nation of immigrants, nation of laws. It's self-defeating. Doesn't that sound a lot like President Trump now. It does, right? Now, of course, back when President Clinton said it, there was collective outrage from the left? Never happened.
And if that's not enough for liberals, there's also President Obama. This is him back in 2014 saying this. Let's look at more hypocrisy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Today, our immigration system is broken and everybody knows it. Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we're also a nation of laws. Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable. If you're a criminal, you'll be deported. If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up.
The actions I'm taking are not only lawful, they're the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and ever single Democratic president for the past half century. And to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer. Pass a bill.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Wow. There you have it. Now, the only reason liberals are resisting President Trump's action on extreme vetting is they're trying to score cheap political points. Now, it doesn't matter that President Obama and Congress came up -- they're the ones that came up with the list of seven countries that President Trump referred to in his executive order. And liberals -- they don't seem to mind one bit that according to The New York Post, visa holders from these seven countries that have ties to terror and extremism are now rushing into the country while they can, thanks to the courts.
Now, President Trump's policy is very straightforward. Instead of twisting and misrepresenting Donald Trump's intentions, well, the left should listen very closely to what the president said earlier today. Listen closely, especially if you're a liberal.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We need strong programs so that people that love us and want to love our country and will end up loving our country are allowed in, not people that want to destroy us and destroy our country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: My message to the left tonight is very clear. You want to keep playing games, you go right ahead. But know this. If one American loses their life, is killed as a result of letting in dangerous, unvetted people into this country, you are to blame and you will have blood on your hands and you can explain that to the American people why you put politics ahead of their safety.
Earlier today, I spoke to the special counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway, and here's what she said.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: Kellyanne, good to see you.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Hi.
HANNITY: You know, you look at the history of all this, seems to be to be all politics, great hypocrisy on display. What if somebody that is not vetted is killed (sic) in the meantime? What does that mean? Are they willing to gamble with American lives?
CONWAY: Well, this is the president's entire point, Sean. He has a right, he has a responsibility, the authority, and indeed, the duty to protect Americans, and that's what he's trying to do here.
The statute that you read, the past comments from liberals like President Obama and President Bill Clinton are very closely aligned with what President Trump is trying to do now as our commander-in-chief and president.
We find that the particular order coming out of the Seattle judge is overly broad. It's a nationwide injunction. He referenced religion, when, in fact, that has nothing to do with the executive order. It's not in there. And the fact is that we don't even know if these states that sued have standing. Individuals have standing and individuals usually need to show harm and damages.
HANNITY: You know, the other thing is the total dishonesty here. I'm going to put up on the country -- on the screen, 43 countries, OK, majority Muslim countries representing 90 percent of the world's Muslims are not included in the ban, including Indonesia, 258 million Muslims, Egypt 95 million, Bangladesh 156 million, Pakistan 201 million.
But the news media keeps saying it's something it's not. That's got to be frustrating when they say it's a litmus test, as Chuck Todd has said, a religious test or a Muslim ban. What is your reaction to the false reporting?
CONWAY: Well, the reaction is that President Obama himself said that these same seven countries needed special screening. They weren't just picked out of a hat. They are -- they were actually designated by President Obama and the Congress as needed special screening. They have a tradition and history of training, harboring and exporting terrorists. And we've seen that.
And I know there's article that's not getting much play today that I really want to call to everybody's attention. It's in the Associated Press by Eric Tucker. And he basically fact checked Judge -- the judge in Seattle, Judge Robart, and said the judge was incorrect when he said that no one has been arrested for extremism under this kind of...
HANNITY: I pointed that out on my radio show. That's -- you're exactly right.
CONWAY: Well, I appreciate that. And this is such an important thing for everybody to know because the judge from the bench had asked the attorney how many people have actually been arrested under this type of order, and she said, I don't know. And he said, I'll tell you, zero. And that's just not true. And I'm sure that everybody can look at Eric Tucker, Associated Press. I don't hear the media covering this. This should be the biggest story of the day in that -- especially since...
HANNITY: He was wrong!
CONWAY: ... they're -- you know, he was wrong, but he did it from the bench. You know, all of us are wrong once in a while, Sean, and we apologize and immediately rectify it, but this is the judge who then said that the -- issued a nationwide injunction from the bench in Seattle in the 9th circuit...
HANNITY: Yes.
CONWAY: ... and was just wrong from the bench in what he said about what this type of extreme vetting would provide or could have prevented had it been in place earlier.
HANNITY: You know, Kellyanne, there are many countries that if you have an Israeli passport, they don't -- Muslim countries that do not let you in their country just because you have an Israeli passport. I want to put up on the screen and show you something. This...
CONWAY: That sounds like a religious test.
HANNITY: Yes, that does sound like a religious test.
CONWAY: And this is not.
HANNITY: Democracy matters strategic plan for action. This was discovered by The Washington Free Beacon. It involves David Brock. And inside this memo, it has plans for defeating Trump, A, through impeachment, through government misinformation, the midterm elections, and more importantly, filing lawsuits against the Trump administration.
So that's pretty much telling me that they're going to judge shop for the next four years to defeat the administration on every agenda item. How do you combat that?
CONWAY: You combat it by doing what the president's already doing, which is and showing progress and solutions and forward-moving action on behalf of people, and then they'll get it. They'll see who is against them. They'll see who's actually making a positive difference in their lives. In just the first two weeks on the job, this man has boosted wages, created jobs, opened up the pipelines, Dakota pipeline, Keystone pipeline, taken us out of TPP, made sure that factories that can stay here and not go to Mexico or workers going to -- or labor going to China, production going to China, that that stops.
He, of course, has met with manufacturing CEOs. He has reversed corrosive regulations that are hurting small business owners. You know, presidents are judged by their accomplishments over time and the real impact they've had on people. And Sean, I can't tell you, for all the negativity out there towards the president and towards all of us here at the White House how many more people across this country write us, text us, e-mail us, call us, stop us wherever we are and just say, Thank you. Thank you for trying to make a difference. Thank you for taking the fire and making a difference.
Now, if the professional left wants to continue with this permanent campaign and never actually accept the results that this is everyone's president and he is trying to do good for everyone, then they'll have to -- then people can judge for themselves.
I mean, I think the left is not off to a really good start. They sound like a bunch of crybabies.
HANNITY: They are crybabies.
CONWAY: And speaking of hypocrisy -- speaking of hypocrisy, what about all these Democratic senators who voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to a federal appeals court...
HANNITY: Unanimously.
CONWAY: ... already 10 years ago? What's changed now except for politics? So the hypocrisy there -- the American people can see that. They can see what these protesters are really saying, what they're really about, and they can judge for themselves. They can protest. Here at the White House, we're going to make progress.
HANNITY: All right, Kellyanne, great to see you, as always. Thank you for taking time.
CONWAY: Thank you, Sean.
HANNITY: I know you're busy every day.
Now, coming up, a ""Hannity"" special investigation. We sent our cameras down to ride along with the Border Patrol this weekend. Look at what they found, among many things, 400 pounds of drugs. That's coming up next. We'll also get reaction from Geraldo.
And also tonight...
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: The men and women of the United States military -- they are the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the earth.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Is a showdown with Iran imminent? President Trump visits U.S. Central Command earlier today. Colonel Oliver North is here with that and more tonight as ""Hannity"" continues.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(NEWSBREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Mexico with the United States has out-negotiated us and beat us to a pulp through out past leaders. They've made us look foolish. We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico. On top of that, the border is soft and weak. Drugs are pouring in. And I'm not going to let that happen.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right, that was President Trump vowing to stop the cartel- fueled drugs and violence from pouring into our country from Mexico. So the question is, just how bad is the situation down at the southern border? Now, last week, we sent one of our producer to Arizona to check it out for you, and what they found once again is shocking. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How far south are you?
AGENT VINCENTE PACO, U.S. BORDER PATROL: We have (INAUDIBLE) type of fencing here that allows us to see through the fence and address any threats that might be approaching the fence. This is where the pedestrian fencing ends. We're about five miles west of the city of (INAUDIBLE) .
The terrain in this location is, as you can see, is very rugged.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This here is referred to as a vehicle barrier. This used to be a known drive-through location where we have vehicles driving through. And right here is evidence that there's a lot of traffic through here.
This is a known drug smuggling route. There is evidence that drug mules come through this area because you can see that there's these bundle straps. These bundle straps here are used to tie the bundles together, and then they're -- you know, they put them up like that and make them into, like, small backpacks.
For somebody to walk all the way this way, they probably already walked a day in Mexico before they cross into the United States because there's really no towns out here.
Right now, we're about a mile southeast of Aho (ph), Arizona. So we had air support, picked up a group of suspected drug mules in the area. One agent interdicted a group, and he has contraband with him. While agents were responding, one of the agents came across what seems to be abandoned marijuana.
Doesn't look like it's part of a group we're working, but sometimes we get close to the area and drug mules abandon their load and then they run back to Mexico to avoid apprehension.
Each of these barrels weighs around 50 pounds. Thee are about 20 kilos a pack.
What we're going to do right now is we're going to try to get close to assist the other agent that they need right now. You know, we don't know if they're outstanding individuals. The good thing is that we got air support nearby (INAUDIBLE) going to try find a safe zone to land in and help them out with that.
By the time the agents showed up because they were up in the mountains, the smugglers have dropped their contraband. Good thing that we had air assets nearby where they were able to go respond and assist in the search of the bundles. So what we're going to do right now is we're going to break them down individually. Then we're going to tag them. We're going to weigh each one of Them.
Agents are weighing, breaking down the bundles individually. They're tagging them. What's going to happen from here is they're going to get eventually turned over to the Drug Enforcement Agency who ultimately takes custody of the contraband. Once we interdict it, the group -- the agents exhausted all resources available to look for the individuals. But you know, more than likely that they made their way back into Mexico once we -- once they knew we were moving into their location. As you can tell, they have the high ground when we were driving in, so they saw us moving into their location.
We interdicted a total of 18 bundles of contraband with a total weight of over 400 pounds of marijuana, these 400 pounds that are not going to make it into the streets today.

HANNITY: 400 pounds caught in that raid alone. Joining us now with reaction to what you just saw, FOX News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera.
All right, I have been down 12 times -- horseback, all-terrain vehicle, boats, helicopters. Me on horseback was funny by the way. I have been to drug warehouses. I was there when gangs were arrested, gang members were arrested -- have it all on video. And the drug warehouse, floor to ceiling, the biggest warehouse you've ever seen.
Isn't this issue also not about the drugs and the cartels and the gang?. What if they were terrorists? What if they were bringing in nuclear material?
GERALDO RIVERA, FOX CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's an excellent question. I just want to compliment the producer. I don't know which one...
HANNITY: Dan Comb (ph).
RIVERA: Dan Comb. Well, congratulations to him because it's one thing to talk about drugs being smuggled, it's another thing to see the vivid graphic evidence of it right before your very eyes.
In terms of the wall -- and I think that's where the conversation has to go. I think the wall will stop casual drug dealers. It'll stop the pot smuggler. The question is whether it will stop the El Chapos. Remember, there are 75 tunnels that have been identified over the 2,000-mile border, 75...
HANNITY: I was in one. I was in one
RIVERA: And of course, I was in El Chapo's...
HANNITY: Right.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: I remember that, yes.
RIVERA: I think the pros will fly over it. They'll tunnel under it. They'll drive around it. I think it will stop the small-timers. And of course, now, as the United States legalizes pot and produce so much of our own now, I think that demand will drop...
HANNITY: Are you...
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Aren't you worried more about the heroin, the kids that try vicodin, percocet, oxycontin, and then move to heroin?
RIVERA: Go back to what you said earlier about national security and terrorists sneaking across. As far as I know, there has not yet been a verified penetration of our southern border by any terrorist, not yet. Thank God.
HANNITY: I don't believe that.
RIVERA: All I know is what the record...
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Here's what we do now.
RIVERA: Not yet.
RIVERA: We have a thousand ongoing investigations of radical Islamists in all 50 states. That's just a fact. Where they came from, we don't know.
RIVERA: But did you notice there was a fence in most of the area that you were talking about. So would a fence twice as high work twice as well?
HANNITY: Double fencing...
HANNITY: I'm not so sure.
HANNITY: ... across most of the border, and then there are other techniques. Here's the thing...
RIVERA: You know, I withdrew my objection. I think that if...
HANNITY: I know you did.
RIVERA: If you're willing to spend, if the taxpayers of the United States...
HANNITY: No, Mexico's going to pay for it.
HANNITY: ... are willing to spend up to $25 billion...
HANNITY: Yes!
RIVERA: I think that we have to see now -- and the most interesting thing is within the Republican Party, people like Senator John Cornyn and others -- of Texas and others, are saying, or beginning to say, Wait. As infrastructure priorities go, this is not the top of our list. We have to really make sure that there's a spending offset, where the budget doesn't go to hell (INAUDIBLE)
HANNITY: That goes for all spending. And I know that's a priority, but national security's got to be the number one priority.
Up next tonight here on ""Hannity""...

TRUMP: The men and women of the United States military, they are the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the earth.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: President Trump visited U.S. Central Command earlier today. We'll get reaction from ""War Stories"" host Oliver North. Is there a ratcheting up of tensions with Iran? President Trump allow calling out fake news again. Larry Elder, Mercedes Schlapp weigh in on that.
Also, Super Bowl LI did not disappoint. We'll get reaction to the big game from my buddy, Steven A. Smith of ESPN, straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: For proof that our nation has been blessed by God, look no further than the men and women of the United States military. They are the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the earth and that the world has ever known. The challenges facing our nation nevertheless are very large, very, very large. We're up against an enemy that celebrates death and totally worships destruction. You've seen that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Very true. That was President Trump earlier today. He was talking to CENTCOM and hew as at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, his first trip as commander-in-chief to the headquarters for the U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command.
During his speech, along with praising our fighting forces, President Trump promised that radical Islamic terrorism will be defeated. Here now with reaction, the host of ""War Stories"" Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North.
All right, Colonel, let me just lay out a history here because there is a new sheriff in town. I don't think the media is seeing what's going on. General Flynn puts Iran on notice. President Trump tweets out, it's -- I'm not Obama. He was way too kind. Then sanctions are put in place. Then the USS Cole is positioned off the coast of Yemen which would have pretty quick access to the Straits of Hormuz.
Very different from Obama, 100 -- $1.7 billion, paying ransom, allowing them to spin centrifuges, 25 days notice for inspections, no U.S. inspectors, not any place, any time.
If I'm the Iranians right now, I think I'm thinking they -- he is preparing to go after my nuclear sites. Am I reading this right or am I wrong?
OLIVER NORTH, ""WAR STORIES"" HOST: Well, he's certainly taken nothing off the table, Sean. And the fact is, add to that little list of things that are happening out in the part of the world, the George Herbert Walker Bush, CVN-67 -- its carrier strike group is now in the Mediterranean headed east, and that ought to give them something really to think about.
The sanctions that he started last Friday target 25 IRGC members. That's the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, their businesses, the individuals, the bank accounts. And it's aimed at the suppliers who are aiding and abetting Iran's ballistic missile program.
And you don't need a ballistic missile program unless you've got a nuclear weapons program. So these are individuals and entities who are procuring the technology and the materials to support the missile program, and it includes those -- and I quote -- ""acting on behalf of or providing support to the IRGC Quds Force, which is, of course, their special operations units that are rampant in Iraq, some in Syria, certainly some down in Yemen helping the Houthis. So these (ph) unilateral course of sanctions like those are generally ineffective because fewer if any of those 25 entities are doing any business in the U.S. But...
HANNITY: I assume...
NORTH: ... here's the good news.
HANNITY: Yes.
NORTH: Let me just -- good news. You can fix that with a very simple amendment. In seven days, all business and banks doing any business whatsoever with the aforementioned Iranian entities and/or similar entities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the DPRK, will be barred from doing any business in the United States. That will stop that program.
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: The Iranian precipitated this by firing the ballistic missile tests that they had. Then they've been sabre rattling on top of that. We know Donald Trump doesn't want a protracted war, doesn't believe in a ground war. So we now have ourselves with a very complicated situation, a-squared, b-squared equals c-squares. Iranian Mullahs, the number one state sponsor of terror, if they get nuclear weapons, they said they will use them. Do you see a potential alliance with the United States, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, the Egyptians, Jordanians, and Israelis to take out nuclear sites that are very cleverly are spread all throughout Iran, many of them underground needing bunker busting bombs to get there. Do you think that that operation needs to be done? Whether or not they are planning or not, that's a different story. Should we take that action?
NORTH: I don't think we are going to have to.
HANNITY: Why?
NORTH: Quite frankly, if you look at what happened right after that deal was done in Vienna when Kerry announced it, King Salman in Saudi Arabia invited as guests for a conference El-Sisi from Egyptian, Abdullah from Jordan, Erdogan from Turkey, and Sharif from Pakistan. He also invited the two emirs from Abu Dhabi and Dubai. They all came except for Abdullah because he was targeted for assassination that day. He sent his chief of staff.
What was that meeting about? I'll tell you what it was about. Salman wants those weapons that he bought for the Pakistanis available to him. I think the mostly likely outcome of this is, one, an incredible proliferation of nuclear weapons around the rest of the world. That started with what Obama was doing. And number two, the kinds of things that might well lead to the cooperation that's now extant between the Israelis and the Saudis and the Sunni adversaries of the Shiite radicals in Tehran.
HANNITY: It's going to be it to watch this play out. I don't think people are paying close enough attention. This is ratcheting up quickly. All right, Colonel, good to see you, safe home.
And up next tonight right here on HANNITY.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Much of the media, not all of it, is very, very dishonest. Honestly, it's fake news. It's fake.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: The president railing against fake news. He's been doing it now for weeks today. Well, he was doing it again on Twitter. We'll tell you what he said. We'll get reaction from Larry Elder, Mercedes Schlapp.
And then Super Bowl 51, what an incredible finish. It was the first time the Super Bowl went into overtime. Stephen A. Smith, personal friend, ESPN analyst is here with me, coming up.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Much of the media, not all of it, is very, very dishonest. Honestly, it's fake news. It's fake.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: That was President Trump talking about the alt left radical liberal mainstream media. However, President Trump's words have not stopped the relentless onslaught of smears coming from the biased leftwing press. Trump on Twitter this morning wrote, quote, ""Any negative polls are fake news just like CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting."" The president also tweeted, quote, ""The failing ""The New York Times"" writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years and are now making up stories and sources.""
Now, the consistently biased coverage from the mainstream media is a reason why according to a recent Quinnipiac poll, look at that, 57 percent of voters say most members of the news media are not honest. That number rises to 86 percent among Republicans. I've been saying journalism is dead for years. And the biased press continues to prove it. They've learned nothing from the election.
Here with reaction, Salem nationally syndicated radio host Larry Elder, FOX News contributor Mercedes Schlapp. It's sort of like, Larry, the MLK bust that wasn't removed or when 90 percent of the Muslims are not included in the immigration ban. It is not a Muslim ban, especially the 40 majority Muslim countries, or the threat that Donald Trump had a call with President Nieto of Mexico and was threatening to invade Mexico, or any of these other examples. There's so many now. It's like on a daily basis. What does this mean for the long term for those news organizations?
LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL SYNDICATED HOST: It is about time Republican presidents started pushing back. You have a public editor who used to be with ""The New York Times"" named Arthur Brisbane, Sean, who admitted that ""The New York Times"" had the worldview of, quote, ""a cultural and political progressivism,"" end of quote.
You've got Deborah Howell who used to be the ombudsman for ""The Washington Post,"" and she admitted in the 2008 contest between Romney and Obama that her paper ran more front page stories of Obama, more flattering from page stories of Obama, more pictures of Obama, more flattering pictures of Obama than John McCain. And of course WikiLeaks has exposed not only that the media, major media, ""Washington Post,"" ""New York Times,"" AP, not just taking a side but actively colluding with the media with the Democrats, leftwing Democrats, and advancing their political agenda. This is a completely rejection of their role as guardians over government. So it's about time that somebody pushed back, and I am so pleased that Donald Trump is doing that very thing.
HANNITY: I have a list here, Mercedes, Indonesia, majority Muslim country, 258.3 million Muslims, they weren't banned. Bangladesh, 156 million, Egypt 94.6 million, Pakistan, 201.9 million, and the list, I'll put it up, 40 countries, 40 countries that are not part of the ban. But the mainstream media said this was either a religious litmus test, like Chuck Todd said, or they keep saying Muslim ban. It is just an outright lie for them to say it, but they double down. Why?
MERCEDES SCHLAPP, ""WASHINGTON TIMES"": And you've read the executive order. It is very clear it is a temporary halt on individuals coming into United States from these seven countries. Why I think is a very simple answer. I think it's the fact that these journalists for a long time, these liberal so called journalists have made it very much their goal to basically be as critical as possible of Donald Trump.
They simply cannot accept the fact that this businessman, the underdog won this election last year and now they are having to report on him. And really what they're trying to do is it is a lot of undermining Donald Trump. You go to the editorial pages of ""The Washington Post"" or ""The New York Times,"" it is anti-Trump rhetoric constantly.
Now I understand the newspaper would say the editorial page is not linked to the rest of the newspaper, but when you actually look at the news reporting, whether it was on the Martin Luther King bush, whether it was on President Trump and the threat on Mexico, they are just ridiculous allegations.
HANNITY: Or Neil Gorsuch. Neil Gorsuch founded the Fascism Forever club. That didn't happen either, which was reported.
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: Love you both, thank you.
Coming up, last night's Super Bowl ending was one for the history books. When we get back, a personal friend, ESPN's Stephen A. Smith is in the house, and he's never shy. That's straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Welcome back to HANNITY. So last night millions and millions of people tuned in to watch Super Bowl 51. They witnessed history as quarterback Tom Brady led the New England Patriots on a comeback win against the Atlanta Falcons after being down 18 points at halftime. Here with reaction is the co-host of ""First Take"" on ESPN, a person friend, Stephen A.
STEPHEN A. SMITH, CO-HOST OF ""FIRST TAKE"" ON ESPN: There you go, man.
HANNITY: I say one of my friends, Stephen A.
SMITH: Listen, I appreciate it. Tell the truth. You wanted me on this show because you want to give people the impression you actually know sports, and we both know better.
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: I know Tebow. You spent two years beating up on my buddy.
SMITH: Do you mean my friend Tim Tebow?
HANNITY: My friend. He can't be your friend. That means he is a Christian and he forgives you of all of the crap you say.
SMITH: He is a great guy, he's a great athlete. He just couldn't throw.
HANNITY: Let's see how he does in baseball. Let's go to football.
SMITH: Sure.
HANNITY: Tom Brady, I said before the game, I had my prediction if you want to see it. I picked him by three. And I said the difference between those two teams, and the Falcons have a great team. I'm very impressed with Matt Ryan. What a season he's had. They did well. But the difference is Brady, Belichick, and Kraft.
SMITH: First of all I am proud of stepping out on a limb like that. You picked Brady, a four time champion, entering the game. You really stepped out on a limb there.
HANNITY: Who did you pick?
SMITH: I picked the Patriots. I picked them to win because of Tom Brady, and he put on a show last night. And I have to tell you. I have always been a Joe Montana guy. That was a guy that's number one on my list. It changed last night, because Brady gave me the one thing I thought he was lacking in his career was that Montana moment from 88 when he drove San Francisco down the field and connected with John Taylor. What I saw last night from Brady eclipsed all of that. It was sensational.
HANNITY: There's no words to really describe it, and it was not surprising, that's the other part, because he did it so often.
SMITH: I've been covering sports for 24 years, and I'm telling you right now, I've never seen a performance on an NFL field --
HANNITY: It reminded you of the election this year when Donald Trump won and you call me -- he calls me when I'm doing my radio show. He's like you are wrong, you are wrong. Or he texts me during this show.
SMITH: You are usually wrong.
HANNITY: No, I'm always right.
SMITH: You're usually wrong, but someone has to be here for you.
HANNITY: You say to me all the time you take a lot of crap from people for being my friend. Why is that?
SMITH: Because, you know, it is FOX News, it's you, you are a zealot.
HANNITY: I'm a zealot? You are an anti-Tebow zealot.
SMITH: I'm not, and he's my friend.
HANNITY: I don't believe that until I hear it from him.
SMITH: Ask him, he's my friend. But at the same time, and I hate to say it on national television, even though I think you are wrong about 75 percent of the time, you are right sometimes, a, and b, you are actually a very nice guy.
HANNITY: Oh, now you're softening me up.
SMITH: You are just wrong sometimes.
(LAUGHTER)
SMITH: And I understand and that's why I try to be here for you and you help you out to the best of my ability.
HANNITY: You wrote me and you said your buddy Trump has no chance to win. I still have the text.
SMITH: That was after the tapes came out. I never said that beforehand.
HANNITY: You told me to jump ship now.
SMITH: What I was saying to you is, excuse me, in America, particularly when it comes to presidential elections, we see the kind of rhetoric, we see the kind of behavior --
HANNITY: You know what, when they unfairly attacked you.
SMITH: You go with that.
HANNITY: They unfairly attacked you. SMITH: Listen, we get unfairly attacked all of the time. When you are doing stuff --
HANNITY: Who had your back?
SMITH: Yes, Sean Hannity, you had my back.
HANNITY: Thank you.
SMITH: But at the same time, as much as I appreciate it -- HANNITY: Though you don't, apparently. SMITH: The fact of the matter is that, listen, I wasn't unemployed. As long as I'm employed -- HANNITY: So the controversy is OK.
SMITH: It doesn't bother me.
HANNITY: I'll tell you what I loved about yesterday's game and what I love about champions, what makes this -- this is artistry. Look at even Matt Ryan's pass to Julio Jones. I mean, wow, that was amazing. But the pass and the catch were spectacular. Then you look at Brady and this run through the fourth quarter into overtime. You know what I love, there is an artistry here. Every pass you are threading the needle in football, and you love to see the guys that work so hard do so well.
SMITH: Let me highlight why I picked Brady. I said at the end of the day, if you are going to beat him you've got to blow him out if you're Atlanta. They started four rookies on defense and four second year players, so you have got eight dudes on the defensive side of the ball that are 24 or 25 years of age. But I'm saying the point is that you are experienced. In a game of this magnitude, it's the biggest stage of sports in this nation. And so you have to go up against if it's tight. But you have to come down the line and you've got to go against a dude that's 39 years of age, a four-time champion who has been to six Super Bowls at the time. He's not worried about it. You have to be worried. And those guys --
HANNITY: I liked the Edelman catch. How cool was that?
SMITH: It was a nice. It was nice and David Tyree-ish for the New York Giants when they beat New England.
HANNITY: Only one team has beaten New England in the Super Bowl, twice.
SMITH: Where are you from, man?
HANNITY: New York.
SMITH: So why are just raving about Boston?
HANNITY: I like Tom Brady. And Tom Brady, all you media on the sports side, the sports media are the worst. They want to brutalize every player.
SMITH: Excuse me, excuse me. After the election that we experienced you've got the audacity to talk about sports media? Is that what you just did?
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: We won. We won. Yes, I did. We won.
SMITH: You are talking to sports media, you are talking to political folks, and you sat up there and said the media is dead, the died a long time ago, and not you're talking about sports --
HANNITY: If you lose, they beat the crap out of you.
SMITH: Because you lost.
(LAUGHTER)
HANNITY: But I won, Trump won, Hillary lost. Who did you vote for?
SMITH: I did not vote for Trump. No, I did not. But I will say this. Even though I did not vote for Trump, not only is he our president, he's our president, respect the man, hold him accountable, no question about that. But also, let's be clear, the Trump that I saw before the election was nothing like the Trump that I saw during the campaign.
HANNITY: He was the one I personally told you that.
SMITH: You did. You did. I'll give you credit. You deserve credit for that, and, by the way, I know it is important to get credit, because lord knows you are usually wrong. So it's a good moment for you.
HANNITY: I was right about Obama, I was right about Tebow, and I'm right about Brady, and I'm right about Trump. But I still love you.
SMITH: While we're here on the air you have the audacity to sit up there and challenge me to a debate on ""First Take"" one day. I want you to know I would advise that against you. To be against me two hours, you don't want any parts of that, Sean. You don't want to do that to yourself.
HANNITY: I'll even take you in an MMA match if you want.
SMITH: No, I'll lose to you there. I know you have been studying martial arts.
HANNITY: I have been training five years.
SMITH: I know that. I don't mess with you.
HANNITY: But I love you anyways. Steve, my buddy, thank you. I love your show, too.
SMITH: Thank you.
HANNITY: Up next, we need your help, an important ""Question of the Day"" straight ahead.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
HANNITY: Time for our ""Question of the Day,"" not a political question. How did you like last night's Super Bowl? Just go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think. That's all the time we have left this evening. We will see you back here tomorrow night.

Gannett Media Corp,"United States, Des Moines, Iowa","Nov 29, 2018",Inmates suing for right to porn: 58 plaintiffs seek to overturn new state ban,"Fifty-eight Iowa inmates are suing state officials in federal court, seeking $25,000 each in damages, claiming they have been denied a constitutional right to pornography in the state's prison system.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Des Moines, seeks to overturn a new state law that has shut down designated ""pornography reading rooms"" in Iowa's prisons. The law also prohibits inmates from having nude photos in their cells. The ban includes Playboy magazine, which has long been allowed in the state's nine prisons, which hold 8,575 inmates.
The plaintiffs — who are all inmates at the Fort Dodge Correctional Facility — are led by Allen C. Miles, 70, who is serving a life sentence for the stabbing death of Cheryl Kleinschrodt on March 3, 1982, in Des Moines. The suit claims the law was enacted under the guise of ""morality,"" and blames ""religious tyrants"" who have no regard for the U.S. Constitution or Declaration of Independence.
The lawsuit also contends that if female correctional officers employed in Iowa's prisons for men can't handle an environment that includes photographic matter featuring female nudity and related matters that ""they should find employment elsewhere.""
The suit was filed in late October and the changes took effect Nov. 14. U.S. Judge Robert Pratt in Des Moines has ordered each of the plaintiffs to pay a filing fee or to request that the fee be waived. He also told them to file a new complaint no later than Friday for the case to proceed.
The legislation — approved by the Iowa House and Senate and signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds — was part of a justice system budget bill approved at the end of the 2018 session.
The new law specifically says funds appropriated to the Iowa Department of Corrections shall not be used to distribute or make available any commercially published information or material to an inmate that is sexually explicit or features nudity.
The law reverses a policy in place for three decades since late Chief U.S. District Judge Harold Vietor upheld findings in 1988 that the state's prison rules on pornography were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.
Michael Savala, the Iowa prison system's general counsel, told state lawmakers during the session the legislation mirrors a policy currently used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Iowa prison officials believe the changes will withstand a court challenge from inmates, he said.
""The department really feels that inmates having access to that kind of material does not lend itself to pro-social thinking and behavior and as far as our responsibilities to change the mindset of the offender as they transition back into the community,"" Savala said.
Prison officials also said the elimination of designated prison rooms in which inmates could read sexually oriented material ends a staff-intensive process. Under the old policy, offenders would check out publications and be escorted to a private reading area. When the inmate was finished examining the publication, the magazine would be returned to a staff person, who would inspect it to make sure no pages were been removed and no contraband was inserted into it.
In addition, prison officials said the population of sex offenders has grown significantly in Iowa's prisons since the 1980s and 1990s and prison officials want to keep sexually oriented publications away from them.
However, during Senate debate on the bill, Sen. Rich Taylor, D-Mount Pleasant, a retired Iowa State Penitentiary employee, opposed the legislation. He contended the changes ignore the fact that male inmates have a sexual drive.
""That is just a fact and you have to have some way to relieve that,"" Taylor said. ""This gives the inmates no release point except another offender, and don't think that it doesn't happen.""
Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections, said incarcerated individuals were advised in July that the changes would take effect in mid-November. That gave inmates four months to stop subscriptions to sexually explicit publications and to make arrangements with family and friends, he said.

"Tribune Publishing Company, LLC","United States, Chicago","Oct 17, 2017",Crest Hill latest to ban sale of pets from 'puppy mills' after Chicago ban upheld,"Crest Hill has become the latest Illinois community to limit where pet stores may obtain the animals they sell.
The city council in the southwest suburb voted unanimously to ban stores from offering pets obtained from large commercial breeders.
In doing so, Crest Hill joins a handful of other local governments - including Chicago, Cook County and Waukegan - that have enacted similar bans, aimed at prohibiting pet stores from selling animals from so-called puppy mills.
Entire states are also getting further involved in the regulation of pet sales. In August, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner signed a law banning large breeders from selling to pet stores unless the breeders are licensed by the USDA and have no violations. And last week, California enacted a law requiring pet stores to sell only animals obtained from shelters or animal rescue organizations.
Crest Hill’s ordinance was passed after the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month affirmed the city of Chicago’s right to enact a similar ban in 2015. The appeals court upheld a lower court’s ruling that dismissed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the ban filed against the city by two Chicago pet stores and a breeding firm in Missouri.
Crest Hill’s new law “is essentially banning puppy mill setups, so we’re talking about large scale breeders who are only breeding these (animals) to make money and then passing them off to pet stores,” City Administrator Heather McGuire said.
Under the local ordinance, pet stores can still sell animals but only if they’re from a nonprofit animal care facility, shelter or rescue organization. Consumers may still purchase animals directly from private breeders.
“We are not closing the door to anyone going to a private breeder to get a puppy,” McGuire said.
The ordinance is intended not only to reduce the demand for animals raised in large commercial settings, but also to protect unsuspecting consumers from purchasing an animal that may suffer from health or behavioral problems because of poor care or inbreeding.
“Often, these animals that come from these large commercial breeders have sickness, injury, inbreeding, and pet stores are putting these animals with buyers who don’t know they’ll end up with an animal that will require significant medical attention, and may often have to eventually be put down,” McGuire said.
Crest Hill has one pet store, Puppy in the Window, which relocated last year from Joliet.
The owners of Puppy in the Window could not immediately be reached for comment. McGuire said she believes the owners have decided to close the store, whose methods have been criticized by a local animal welfare organization, Safe Pets for Joliet.
Founder Morgan Drdak said measures such as the one passed in Crest Hill are not aimed at driving pet stores out of business, noting that only a small percentage of the tens of millions of dollars spent on the pet industry is for the purchase of animals themselves.
“The tide is turning,” Drdak said. “On Friday, the entire state of California did this. We’re not surprised, and we’re hoping that more communities - whether they have a pet store or not - will go ahead and be proactive. This is how we can make a difference, this is how we can shut down the puppy mills, this is how we can change the way that animals are treated when they’re bred.”
But Mike Bober, president of Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council, a national trade group representing the pet industry, said ordinances such as the one passed in Crest Hill may make it difficult for pet stores to source dogs from shelters and rescue groups if they refuse to work with the stores. Furthermore, he said the measures ignore the protections already offered to consumers.
“The biggest problem here is that breeders who sell through pet stores are licensed and regulated - that protection, that assurance regarding the source does not exist if you’re buying off of Craigslist or if you’re looking at a dog from a third-party source,” Bober said. “There are protections that people seem to overlook. ... And our concern is that in a desire to do something to address a legitimate concern, towns like Crest Hill are actually doing more harm than good.”
He also questioned why Crest Hill would move forward with the ordinance without giving the new Illinois law a chance to work.
“It seems to me that Crest Hill has unilaterally decided - even before that state law has had any chance to go into effect - that there is no such thing as a responsible breeder,” Bober said.

Reason Foundation,"United States, Washington","Sep 3, 2020","FOSTA Is Unconstitutional, Argue Sexual Freedom Advocates and First Amendment Lawyers in New Motion: Plus: People have doubts about democracy, Washington state sues Juul, and more...","The Woodhull Freedom Foundation is suing (again) to get FOSTA ruled unconstitutional. FOSTA—the 2018 ""human trafficking"" law making it a federal crime to host digital content that promotes prostitution—violates the First and Fifth Amendments, says Woodhull's motion for summary judgment, filed in federal court on August 31. It also takes aim at the law's retroactive scope—FOSTA says you can be punished for violating it even before the law went into effect.
The suit comes after a federal district court dismissed an earlier filing against FOSTA, brought by Woodhull—a nonprofit dedicated ""to affirm[ing] and protect[ing] sexual freedom as a fundamental human right""—and fellow plaintiffs The Internet Archive, Human Rights Watch, Eric Koszyk, and Alex Andrews. In January, a federal appeals court reversed the decision and sent the case back to the district court.
You can find their full motion for summary judgment here (and find previous court filings here). ""Plaintiffs request a declaratory ruling that FOSTA is unconstitutional and a permanent injunction against its enforcement and application,"" the motion states. They claim that ""FOSTA is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, is a content-based statute that cannot satisfy strict scrutiny, and lacks the necessary scienter requirements to be constitutional"" (scienter refers to a person's intent when doing something that the government claims is criminal). ""And it explicitly is meant to have retroactive reach in both its criminal and civil applications.""
Meanwhile, the SAFE SEX Workers Study Act, introduced by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) to pave the way for FOSTA's dismantling, has gone nowhere since its introduction last December. Several civil lawsuits—two against Craigslist and one against Mailchimp—are invoking FOSTA in order to accuse these tech companies of being legally liable for ""sex trafficking.""
Woodhull and the other plaintiffs are represented by Lawrence G. Walters of the Walters Law Group, Bob Corn-Revere of Davis Wright Tremaine, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

Doubts about democracy. A new Pew Research Center poll of Americans finds that ""among the public overall, 68% say it is very important for the country that people are free to peacefully protest, down from 74% two years ago. In this case, the decline has come entirely among Republicans,"" Pew notes.
The poll was conducted from July 27 through August 2 and consisted of 11,001 U.S. adults.
A majority of those surveyed (62 percent) agreed ""that significant changes are needed in the fundamental design and structure of American government to make it work for current times."" Pew points out that ""while views among the public overall have changed little since 2018, Democrats and Republicans have moved further apart in their opinions. Currently, 79% of Democrats say significant changes in the structure of government are needed, compared with 41% of Republicans.""

Washington state files consumer protection lawsuit against Juul. Taking a page from the anti-tobacco playbook, the attorney general of Washington state is accusing vaping company Juul of ""designing and marketing its products to appeal to underage consumers and deceiving consumers about the addictiveness of its product."" Here's the kind of laughable claims the state is making to back up this assertion: ""JUUL's advertising used sharp patterns, bright colors and young models.""

"Ogden Newspapers, Inc.","United States, Marshfield, Wis.","Mar 29, 2019",Some of lame-duck laws return after ruling: Appeals court overturns judge's invalidation,"MADISON - Some of the lame-duck laws limiting the power of Gov. Tony Evers went back into effect Wednesday when an appeals court overruled a Dane County judge who invalidated them last week.
A three-judge panel in Wausau stayed the ruling by Judge Richard Niess, but the court did not act on a separate ruling in a second case that blocked parts of those laws.
For now, those provisions — including ones taking power from Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul — remain sidelined. An appeal in the second case is expected soon, and more court action in both cases is expected in the days and weeks ahead.
Wednesday's ruling immediately raised questions about whether 82 appointees of former Gov. Scott Walker continued to hold their jobs. Niess' ruling invalidated their confirmations last week and Evers quickly rescinded their appointments.
After the appeals court ruled, the two sides disagreed on whether Evers' action stood and whether those jobs were vacant.
While the questions swirled, GOP leaders savored their victory at this stage of the legal fight. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said Wednesday's ruling pauses a ""constitutional crisis.""
""Established law says that the court cannot tell the Legislature how to set its rules,"" they said in their statement.
Meanwhile, Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said, ""The only victory today is for the $500-per-hour Chicago lawyers getting paid by taxpayers to defend the Republican attack on our constitution.""
At issue in the cases are laws Republican lawmakers approved after Evers and Kaul were elected but before they were sworn in.
The laws limited Evers' control of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., required Evers to get permission from lawmakers to make changes to public benefits programs and forced Kaul to get approval from lawmakers to settle lawsuits.
The League of Women Voters of Wisconsin and other groups sued, asking the court to vanquish the lame-duck laws because of the method legislators used to bring themselves into session.
Lawmakers held what is known as an extraordinary session, in which they convene at the Capitol when they're not otherwise scheduled to be there. The groups argued state law and the state constitution don't allow such sessions.
Niess agreed and issued a ruling that blocked the laws and revoked the confirmations of 82 Walker appointees approved by the Senate during the lame-duck session.
After that decision, Evers and Kaul immediately took actions that had been blocked by the lame-duck laws.
Kaul sought to withdraw the state from lawsuits challenging federal environmental rules and the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Evers revoked the 82 appointments.
On Wednesday, the appeals court blocked Niess' ruling while it considers the case. The judges concluded that Wisconsin residents may suffer harm if laws passed by their representatives are prevented from being carried out while the court does its work.
The stay was granted by Mark Seidl, who was elected in 2015; Thomas Hruz, who was appointed by Walker in 2014; and Lisa Stark, who was appointed by Walker in 2013 just before the election. She was the only applicant.
Misha Tseytlin, an attorney for the lawmakers, said the latest decision put the 82 Walker appointees back in their jobs.
""Those people have a statutory right to their jobs because they were duly confirmed by the Senate in December 2018,"" he said by email. ""The governor's hasty, ill-advised actions last week cannot possibly impact those legal rights.""
Baldauff disputed that.
""The stay does not invalidate the withdrawal of the appointees, nor does it affect the governor's ability to make appointments to those vacant positions,"" she said by email.
Most of the positions are on low-profile, part-time boards that provide their members nominal pay. But two of them are for full-time positions — on the Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, and the Labor and Industry Review Commission, which reviews employment law decisions.
Wednesday's decision was the latest in a string of rulings that have come over the last week.
In a separate case brought by unions challenging the lame-duck law, Dane County Circuit Judge Frank Remington on Tuesday blocked some of the provisions of the laws while he considers the case. His ruling remains in effect for now, so those parts of the laws continue to be on hold despite the appeals court's ruling.
An appeal in that case is expected to be filed soon.

CQ Roll Call,"United States, Washington","Jun 12, 2018",Trump Heads Home From Historic Summit; Is North Korea Summit Trump's Finest Hour?; Impact of Trump-Kim Agreement on the Region; Liberal Media Refuse to Give Trump Credit; Tense Relations Between FBI and Congress; DOJ Overturns Obama-era Asylum Ruling; MS-13 Gang Terrorizes Maryland School; Bill Clinton's New Cringeworthy Comments; Robert de Niro Apologizes to Canada for Trump; DOT IG Found Cheating On Air Traffic Controller Tests,"TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST, TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT: Fox's Catherine Herridge is reporting tonight that Rod Rosenstein threatened to subpoena emails and phone records from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee in January. It's an explosive story.
We're going to ask the attorney general about it directly in just a minute.
Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The first-ever meeting between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader has finished. President Trump and Kim Jong-un met one another in Singapore, put their names on a new deal that seeks to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula.
What's in the deal and what else has happened in the summit's wake. For that, we go to chief national correspondent Ed Henry who is in Singapore right now. Ed?
ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, great to see you. President Trump came, he saw, and he got a deal despite all the naysayers trying to talk down the possibility of American success before, during and after these talks.
The president tonight, in fact, is going to go on offense, try to sell this deal on ""Hannity"" next hour, telling Fox that Kim Jong-un is going to start denuclearization virtually immediately with the document they signed here, which he says could save millions of lives by preventing nuclear war.
Remarkable, coming just weeks after North Korea again threatened a nuclear conflict. During one of their walks together, Kim was actually overheard, through his interpreter, telling the president these pictures were so surreal that many in the world will ""think of this as a form of fantasy from a science-fiction movie.""
Democrats like Chuck Schumer tonight are warning this may be an actual fantasy since Kim made no specific commitment to get rid of his nukes, while the president promised to end joint military exercises with South Korea. That has some of our allies concerned.
But Republicans like Sen. John Kennedy today think, on balance, this is a good agreement. Kennedy saying today that, working with Kim is like hand- feeding a shark. You can do it, but you've got to do it very, very carefully. Tucker?
CARLSON: Great metaphor. Thanks, Ed.
Is the new deal with North Korea actually a deal? Is it good for the United States? Can we trust North Korea to follow it?
Doug McGregor is a retired US army colonel, author of the book ""Margin of Victory"". Congressman Jeff Fortenberry is a Republican, represents the State of Nebraska. And both of them join us tonight.
Congressman, first to you. Is this a deal Americans ought to be happy about?
REP. JEFF FORTENBERRY (R), NEBRASKA: Well, the best word that I can use to describe the last few days, in my mind, is stunning. I think the president's actions here are bold, they're historic, it's almost unimaginable given where we were just six months ago, where we were on the precipice of some type of even potential nuclear exchange
The president has leaned into something pretty radical here. And perhaps, he's creating a new architecture for 21st century diplomacy.
He has said to Kim Jong-un, we're going to deal with you, for good or for ill. And if it's for ill and you move your finger toward a nuclear button, we're going to hurt you. But if it's for good, I want to create the space for perhaps authentic dialogue and even friendship. And I think he accomplished that.
He has rejected the norms of ossified proceduralism and stagnation that governed so many international affairs and he took a bold risk and I think delivered something very important. It's his first step. We're holding out hope, obviously, for a greater vision. That could evolve here, but it's an important and good first step.
CARLSON: Ossified proceduralism. A phrase I'm stealing. Colonel, are you as optimistic about it?
COL. DOUGLAS MCGREGOR (RET), ""MARGIN OF VICTORY"" AUTHOR: Extremely. I think this is Donald Trump's finest hour. And I'm absolutely serious.
Donald Trump has recognized something that others have refused to see for a very long time in Washington. It's not simply that North Korea is on the ropes. It is. It's on the verge of collapse. Donald Trump understood that. And that's one of the reasons he was able to put the pressure on North Korea the way he did.
But he also went to great lengths in his meetings with President Xi, to forge an understanding with China. He treated President Xi as an equal, treated China as an equal.
And I think Donald Trump understands something that is not well understood in the Pentagon at this point or in many other places in Washington, and that our competition with China is essentially economic and technologic, it is not military. And that was the key development because, without China, none of this would have happened
CARLSON: Yes, that's right. And I think it clearly stemmed from what he said about trade with China.
Congressman, there's been a lot of criticism of this deal from the left, along the lines that the president is giving away important American advantages in exchange for nothing. How would you respond to that?
FORTENBERRY: This is the combination of foreign policy realism and entrepreneurial diplomacy. And as I said, this is not only about potentially preventing a conflict and opening up a new chapter and rejecting a stalemate of the last 65 years with North Korea, but it also could signal a new way, a new architecture for diplomatic relations moving forward.
Look, the world is screaming for some type of new interpersonal ecosystem both in our homes and in our communities, as well as between nations.
And what that means is that we have to have the ability to reach out and provide authenticity and dialogue and create some space because the world is racing toward destructive technology, and then what?
Civilization itself is at stake and we've got to find a way forward toward mutuality and well-being and mutual security. Or else, we don't have much hope.
CARLSON: But, I mean, colonel, a lot of what we have heard liberals, and some conservatives, by the way, criticize the idea that you meet with someone who is morally out-of-bounds, like Kim Jong-un. Going forward, should we be willing to meet with anybody?
MCGREGOR: Oh, absolutely. And I think Donald Trump is a disruptive force. Let's be frank. He's disrupting the status quo. Lots of people in this town are very upset because this threatens to change the distribution of cash. This threatens budgets. This threatens support structures. This threatens a number of things.
He recognized early on when he was campaigning that South Korea is a powerful state, infinitely more powerful than North Korea and quite capable of defending itself.
He recognized that Japan is also in the same position. In fact, if Japan raises its investment in the military power by just 1 percent, Japan will be number three in the world in terms of its defense budget.
He understands that what Northeast Asia wants and needs is stability, order and prosperity, not war. And I think he's got the agreement of everyone who counts in the region.
CARLSON: That's an amazing statistic about Japan, by the way, which most of us consider demilitarized. Apparently not.
Colonel, congressman, thank you both very much.
FORTENBERRY: Thank you.
MCGREGOR: Thank you.
CARLSON: What effect will this summit have on the rest of Asia? A meaningful question for the rest of the world.
Michael Pillsbury is the man to answer. He's a senior fellow and director of China strategy at the Hudson Institute. Author of maybe the single best book recently on China called ""The 100 Years Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower"". Dr. Pillsbury joins us tonight.
So, what effect, Michael Pillsbury, does this have on the rest of Asia, if any, right now?
MICHAEL PILLSBURY, ""THE 100 YEARS MARATHON"" AUTHOR: Well, it doesn't have much effect on the rest of Asia until more is revealed by President Trump on the what the next steps are going to be. He has laid the foundation for moving forward.
He's sent Secretary Pompeo up to Beijing. I myself have heard from the Chinese already that they are taking credit for this. They are a little bit hurt that President Trump did not give them any credit when he was in Singapore.
They feel they sent the plane, they put the pressure on, they did the sanctions, they voted for these UN Security Council resolutions three times and made the toughest sanctions in history. They all but pushed Chairman Kim into this. And here is their friend, Donald Trump, not tipping his hat to them.
But the president, as you know, is not finished talking about this.
CARLSON: To think of the Chinese Politburo as having a heart and being - having its feelings hurt, that's so interesting.
PILLSBURY: Well, we don't care if their feelings are hurt. I'm going to Beijing tomorrow. So, I've got to be careful what I say, Tucker.
CARLSON: Yes.
PILLSBURY: But I would say the reaction in Asia depends on how much concern they had about - any given country had about nuclear weapons in North Korea.
So, down in Southeast Asia, this is not really a topic. They are much more concerned about the South China Sea. Is the US really going to have some ships that go inside the 12-mile boundary and then have helicopter operations or swerve around and not request innocent passage?
This is not a technical matter. Under the law of the sea, there are five things that, if you do that, you are saying I dispute this claim. We have not done those five things.
We usually go in with our radar turned off. We don't do swerving turns. We don't launch helicopters. So, we are recognizing the Chinese claim. At the same time, we are mildly challenging. This is a big issue in Southeast Asia.
In Taiwan, they're still waiting for the F-16 replacements. They asked for 55 F-16 jet fighters about ten years ago. Forty-eight or so US senators wrote a letter. They held up the deputy secretary of state give these jet fighters to Taiwan. They are for sale. They're not fully gifts. That has still not happened. So, Taiwan is kind of wondering what is their future?
In Japan, they've got a series of issues they want to hear more about. So, the North Korea issue, as you know very well, Tucker, is really a bit more about the United States feeling vulnerable to kind of a crazy person with H bombs and 50 ICBMs, if that's what it should come to.
That problem seems to be taken care of. So, Americans can be happy. We can admire President Trump. He's done something for us.
But the rest of Asia is still awaiting for answers to a broader Asia strategy, I think, and President Trump is working on that. That's what his team has been telling me.
CARLSON: I'd be worried if I was in Taiwan. Michael Pillsbury, thank you very much. Great to see you.
PILLSBURY: Thank you.
CARLSON: Just a few months ago, the press was upset about President Trump's overly aggressive posture toward North Korea. Now, they're claiming he's too friendly to North Korea. We'll try to make sense of that. Next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: It was just a few months ago that the press was in love with North Korea because of their impressive Olympic delegation and publicly feared President Trump was about to start a war with them. Remember that?
Well, during yesterday's summit, the president was friendlier. So, was MSNBC happy? No. And here's a selection.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST, ""DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE"": It is not knowable that we will ever know really what happened in that meeting business both men are known and established liars.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would say it's somewhat disgusting. It is actually a debasement of the American flag.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Donald Trump can relate to authoritarian. As a former businessman, he likes absolute control.
CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST, ""HARDBALL"": Is he a wannabe despot?
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have conceded that for years now.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: And the frenzy continued over at ""The Washington Post"". Ishaan Tharoor said that the summit showed Trump's ""affinity for dictator"". CNN analyst and avid pro-war activist Max Boot dismissed the whole summit as something any US prior president could have achieved, though none did.
In ""The Week"" magazine, Damon Linker said that even a successful summit would be bad because it would improve Trump's approval ratings and that ""could only be considered positive if you think it's a good thing for our mendacious, hapless, impetuous, racist president to enjoy an unprecedented boost to his popularity."" In other words, if it works, that's bad because Trump will benefit.
Joe Concha covers media for ""The Hill"" and he joins us tonight. So, you've been watching the coverage, Joe. Sum it up for us.
JOE CONCHA, ""THE HILL"" MEDIA REPORTER: Well, that last line is interesting because it sounds a lot like, Tucker, Bill Maher on Friday night who said bring on a recession even if it cripples families and people across the country because that would be the only thing that could get Trump from being reelected.
And by the way, Maher is worth something like $100 million. He gets 10 million a year.
CARLSON: Yes, I know.
CONCHA: So, when Trump is gone, who cares if we go to war or if we go to recession as long as liberals can triumph in terms of getting rid of Trump. That's all that matters.
I noticed that montage. It's very interesting. You played Nicolle Wallace. And she used to be a member of the Bush administration, right? She was the communications director.
You played Elise Jordan who is a member of the Bush administration. I heard Jeremy Bash who was in the Obama administration in the DoD.
What do all of these people have in common? They all worked in administrations that failed miserably in stopping North Korea's nuclear program.
So, if you're a viewer and you're sitting at home, you have to ask yourself this very question, why are we listening to these people? I mean, they failed in Iran, Syria, Iraq, you name it, depending on the administration, and they are presented as experts when, obviously, they have an agenda because they want to protect their own legacies or the legacies of their bosses.
It would be like turning to Jack Kevorkian to teach a class in the Heimlich Maneuver. It's a complete contradiction.
CARLSON: That's a very good point.
But couldn't it be said - well, no, it's apt. But couldn't that be said of so many different issues in which analysts on television are implicated in failing policies that were rejected by voters. And so, why wouldn't their contempt be baked in? Why wouldn't they hate all of this because it basically points up how badly they did their jobs?
CONCHA: Right. And it's the uncouth president that is actually succeeding in this case. I understand the criticism completely around whether this is a success or not because they're very broad strokes.
But then again, we're in the first out of the first inning. And unless every ""i"" is dotted and ""t"" is crossed and is being considered a failure, but to your point earlier with another guest, think of where we were in August when President Trump said that North Korea will see ""fire and fury"" like the world has never seen.
And if you go back and read those headlines, we are on the precipice of World War III. Guam was being threatened. We had actual maps of what nuclear missiles could hit Los Angeles, Chicago, New York.
CARLSON: Yes, I remember.
CONCHA: Think of where we were then and think of where we are now in terms of talking to this leader, having them agree at least in broad strokes around denuclearization. That is progress.
No matter how you try to spin it, that has to be seen as progress except it's not presented that way because there is always a reflex to the negative when it comes to this administration, even in the most obvious situation when there really isn't much negative things to complain about when you put it in the full context.
CARLSON: Very quickly, is there any indication that any of these self- described experts knows anything about North Korea at all?
CONCHA: I don't know if many people know much about North Korea, right? I mean, how many of them have actually been there? Any journalist for that matter or any experts in this regard?
So, I would say no. And again, when you have a Clinton, a Bush and an Obama administration that failed over 25 years doing the same thing in terms of nice talk and appeasement and then somebody else comes in and does something different, you are in no position whatsoever to complain about these things.
And that's the final point I want to make, Tucker, that we're very good in this business about complaining about stuff and that's all I've heard over the last 48 hours - complaint, complaint.
But when you are watching this coverage, listen for this. Is anybody offering an alternative or a solution as to what they would do as opposed to what they have witnessed over the last 48 hours? Because I haven't seen it yet, Tucker.
CARLSON: But how about just stand back and be amazed for a minute? Because it is amazing. That's how I feel about it anyway. Joe, great to see you.
CONCHA: Stunning. Your guest used stunning before, and that's correct.
CARLSON: It's true. Thanks. Up next, Attorney General Jeff Sessions just reversed an Obama era policy that promoted migration from Latin America. He's here to talk about it.
And also to respond to a remarkable new story. Fox News is reporting Rod Rosenstein, deputy AG, threatened Republicans on the House Intel Committee. That's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Attorney General Jeff Sessions occasionally endures Twitter criticism from his boss, but that has not frozen him into inaction.
Just yesterday, the attorney general reversed an Obama-era policy that granted asylum to migrants who claimed they feared gang violence or domestic violence in their home countries. It turns out the overwhelming majority of those applications were false. The attorney general joins us tonight. Mr. Attorney General, thanks for coming on.
JEFF SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: Hey, thank you, Tucker.
So, I want to ask you about this. But, first, I have to ask you about a piece of breaking news. Our Catherine Herridge just has out saying that, in January of this year, January 10, Deputy General Rosenstein went up to the Hill and met with Republican members of the House Intel Committee, had a dispute with them and threatened them with a subpoena of their emails and phone records.
This is what one of them said. ""I read it as a not-so-veiled threat to unleash the full prosecutorial power of the state against us."" DOJ on background has confirmed that something like that did happen. What is that about?
SESSIONS: Well, I don't know that they have confirmed that exactly. In fact, the FBI director, the senior ethics attorney for the Department of Justice who was in the room, say that's a mischaracterization really of what occurred.
And it also, I think, indicates that there's been a breakdown of relationships when, in fact, since January, a great deal of progress has been made.
We understand in this department that we are accountable to the president, we are accountable to Congress and we need to be cooperative with them to produce as many documents as rationally and legally and properly as can be produced - to produce them and we've made tremendous progress in that regard really.
CARLSON: Did the deputy attorney general threaten to subpoena the email or phone records of members of the House Intel Committee?
SESSIONS: Well, I was not in the room and I can't speak to what occurred. All I can say is that the people - Chris Wray, the director of the FBI, and our senior ethics attorney was there and others and did not see it in that same fashion.
CARLSON: OK. So, as a factual matter, you don't think that that happened?
SESSIONS: I'm confident that Deputy Rosenstein, 28 years in the Department of Justice, did not improperly threaten anyone on that occasion. But we do believe that we have tried to be cooperative with them and made progress in months - as the months have gone by. And, in fact, have had some good relationships with the top members of Congress.
CARLSON: OK. So, you have made news recently by undoing an Obama-era rule about asylum-seekers. Give us the overview. I think most Americans like the idea that this would be a haven for people suffering around the world. Lots of people claim asylum. What do we know about the veracity of their claims?
SESSIONS: That's a good question. Seven years ago, 5,000 people applied for asylum claiming a credible fear of being at home in their home country and they needed to flee that country.
That number jumped to 94,000 in just seven years. It's overwhelming our system. Over 80 percent of those claims are being denied by the immigration judges as being not meritorious.
So, it is a big problem for us. Each one of those is requiring trials and factual decisions by our judges. We're going to add 100 judges, and that may yet not be enough judges to handle the cases.
We need to give the judges better guidance. They need to go back to the fundamental principles in laws and rules of the Immigration and Nationalization Act. And if we do that, then we are in a position where some of these cases can be promptly decided.
You do not get to come to America if you have a private threat or someone personally attacks you. You do not get to have asylum for that based on your race, your religion, your nationality.
If you are part of some special identifiable group that's being persecuted in your home country, that's what it takes to have an asylum and we need to get this straight. And I think it will help us, the decision I made.
I believe it's right legally and I'm totally confident it's consistent with the intent of the drafters of the INA, our law, and I believe it will help us manage our caseloads better and give more focus to the people who deserve to be given asylum and help us eliminate those that are not worthy of this asylum.
CARLSON: With over 80 percent of the applications are fraudulent, there's obviously a problem.
So, the DOJ has also recently weighed in on the question of speech on campus. What can the federal government, the Department of Justice do to ensure that people's First Amendment rights are protected? And why has it taken until 2018 to get DOJ involved in this?
SESSIONS: It's one of the big challenges of our time, I have come to believe, and it's almost unbelievable that major colleges and universities would be taking action that restricts the right of free speech on a college campus. It's just got to be confronted.
We have the authority under law to file a statement of interest in an ongoing litigation. So, cases are being filed against the universities by students who complain. And if we think their complaints are meritorious, then we can file a statement of interest joining with them and explaining why we, at the Department of Justice, think these concerns are real and justified and a court relief is appropriate.
So, we've had some success. We've had two cases where there has been a major change in the college and university's actions, and two cases where the judge has dismissed or rejected a motion to dismiss these cases by the universities, and allowing the trials to go forward.
We think it's a very important thing. Students should be participating in robust debate. They ought not to be intimidated. They ought not to be driven by political correctness to where you can't even speak up in class or on campus.
CARLSON: It's just amazing what an upside down world it is when a conservative attorney general is defending the First Amendments against liberals. It's like things have changed almost too much.
Mr. Attorney General, thank you. I appreciate it.
SESSIONS: Thank you. Good to be with you.
CARLSON: MS-13 gang members are menacing kids at a school just a few miles from the White House. Why are so many so determined to defend them? That is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Less than 10 miles from the White House, a middle school is being terrorized by MS-13. It's called William Wirt Middle School. It's in Riverdale, Maryland. And it's one of many whose makeup has been changed entirely and almost overnight by mass settlement of unaccompanied minors entering this country from Latin America.
Now, according to ""The Washington Post"", MS-13 members in the school start fights, sell drugs, rape fellow students. Teachers say they fear being alone with a lot of these kids. They also fear saying anything about it because speaking out could cost them their jobs.
It's a tragedy that can be traced almost entirely to US immigration policy, but elites don't seem to care at all and, in fact, crush any conversation about it by screaming ""racist.""
Needless to say, their kids will never attend William Wirt Middle School or anything even approaching it.
Jose Aristimuno is a former DNC press secretary and he joins us tonight. Jose, thank you for coming on.
JOSE ARISTIMUNO, FORMER DNC PRESS SECRETARY: Good to be with you.
CARLSON: What I found ironic about the story was this is this kind of third iteration of the MS-13 story. First, we were told they don't really exist, it's a figment of your racist imagination. Then we were told to attack them and call them names is immoral because they're good people.
And now, we have ""The Washington Post"" telling us in detail about how they've destroyed this middle school and are terrorizing the students. Are we allowed to acknowledge that or are we bigots for doing so?
ARISTIMUNO: Well, no. Let me start by saying this. If you're undocumented in this country, if you are a criminal including being a member of MS-13, we don't want you in this country and you should be deported.
Part of the issue here, Tucker, is that people like yourself and some Republicans want to pinpoint and just simply say because your first name Jose or you're Latino, like me, I'm automatically an ms-13 gang member. And that is not true.
CARLSON: OK. You're a ridiculous person for saying that. I have never suggested anything like that. It's appalling that you would say that. I don't think that and I've never suggested. You are speaking a lie, and not for the first time.
What I said is what I read in ""The Washington Post"", which is self- identified gang members are destroying the school and terrorizing people. I bet you don't have kids at that school. I bet you never send your kids to that school.
But you've got no problem with those people being in this country because it fits with the sort of demographic kind that you approve of. The truth is it's a disaster.
ARISTIMUNO: That's not true. I just said it, if you're an MS-13 gang member, if you're undocumented, you should be deported. A majority of people who are -
CARLSON: An undocumented - no, no. Then why have you consistently attacked anybody - yes, right. Nobody has said that the majority of immigrants are criminals or bad. I'm not saying that. I don't think it.
What I am saying is that -
ARISTIMUNO: The president has said that. The president has said that.
CARLSON: He has not said that. You are lying for political gain as always. What I have said and what I think many normal people have said is that we don't know who's coming into this country, we don't know anything about them.
There are 20 million of them living here. We don't know their identities, their background -
ARISTIMUNO: I've got an idea for you.
CARLSON: And some of them are bad people.
ARISTIMUNO: OK. So, you know what we do? Let me tell you what we do. We pass comprehensive immigration reform. We legalize a majority of people. It will be a whole lot easier, Tucker, to actually look for the real criminals if we legalize the good ones. Don't you think so?
CARLSON: I mean, it's hilarious if that solution comports exactly with your political goal, which is to create more Democratic voters.
ARISTIMUNO: Give me a break.
CARLSON: You tell me rationally how, if illegal immigration, the inability of the US government to know who is living within its borders, is the problem, how encouraging more of it, which is what amnesty would do, is the solution? There's no logic (INAUDIBLE) not something you're interested in solving.
ARISTIMUNO: OK. So, your answer and too many Republicans' answer is to deport the 14 million illegal immigrants, undocumented immigrants in this country.
CARLSON: We are guessing at that number. Some people think it's 20 million.
ARISTIMUNO: OK. 20 million, 14 million, what do we do.
CARLSON: When wage growth has been stagnant and the cost of everything is growing much faster than the growth in wages, you need to stop the ability of employers to hire cheaper people because they are here illegally.
We need to make e-verify mandatory. We cannot hire people here illegally.
No, no, no. Look, if you bothered for on anything about this subject, if you took it seriously and were bigger than a political issue to you, which it's not -
ARISTIMUNO: I take it very seriously.
CARLSON: No, you don't know nothing about it.
ARISTIMUNO: Give me a break. I am telling you, we have a choice to make as Americans. I know more than you. I know more than you.
CARLSON: Then should an employer - you know nothing. You know nothing.
ARISTIMUNO: I know more than you.
CARLSON: Why would an employer in this country be allowed to hire someone illegally, depressing wages for American citizens?
ARISTIMUNO: You want to fix that problem? We reform the system. We legalize the people that are already here. That's what we do.
CARLSON: You could do it, legalize it. You could do it tomorrow. Why should employers be allowed to hire illegal aliens?
ARISTIMUNO: I'm going to say it again. We have two choices.
CARLSON: Look right into the camera and tell me why they should be allowed to do that.
ARISTIMUNO: We've got two choices here, Tucker. We've got two choices. We deport the 14 million or 20 million, whatever number or we legalize them and put them in a path to citizenship, so we can actually get them out of the shadow.
CARLSON: You know what? I don't have time for conversations with people who don't know what they are talking about and haven't thought it through and want to come on and spew more talking points and call anybody who disagrees a racist, which is what you did in the very first sentence of this segment.
ARISTIMUNO: Because that's what you guys have done from the very beginning.
CARLSON: Thank you. Yes, you are pathetic.
Bill Clinton was one of the savviest politicians in American history, but he can't stop destroying himself with his own mouth. Hilarious what he has said recently. We've got the tape for you. Thank you. We'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Bill Clinton is on a roll recently. You may have noticed. In a recent interview with PBS, Clinton pointed out that it's a lot harder to sexually harass people these days than it used to be back then. And, of course, he would know. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think the norms have really changed in terms of what you can do to somebody against their will, how much you can crowd their space, make them miserable at work.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Tammy Bruce is a New York radio show host and she joins us tonight.
Tammy, the norms have really changed about what you can do someone against his will.
TAMMY BRUCE, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE PRESIDENT: Yes.
CARLSON: I don't know if you knew that. Very different now. You used to be able to do a lot of things against people's will.
BRUCE: Hillary may be sharing the chardonnay with her husband, I'm not quite sure.
CARLSON: Oh, god.
BRUCE: This is what most people have, of course, remarked on, is that for Bill Clinton it was normal to do things to people against their will. But this is a news flash for Mr. Clinton.
Unless you were back in maybe the Bronze Age, maybe not even then, in modern life here in America, the American Revolution kind of made it that everybody had some rights and that we became a better country.
And the good news is, in the recent modern era, we have learned that you can't do anything to people against their will. It's the concept, of course, of law and order.
So, we've managed to achieve that. And it was applied when he was president. Apparently, he wasn't aware of that.
But it tells you, and I think this is what's revealing about Bill Clinton, it's what's termed as the compulsion to confess, is that in his time that you could do whatever you wanted, but the fact is they knew then that they really couldn't.
The difference was is that they got away with it and they protected each other. And I think, for both he and his wife, they want that era back. They want the times back, the good old days, when, in fact, they could do whatever they wanted.
And I think this is - it probably was much more comfortable and controlled for very few at the top. It's very nerve-racking for individuals who cultivated that era to have this populism arise where the American people, women and people of color and gays, everybody who has been in minority in power or in life, actually because of new media and because of the populism now that's moving is that we want the constitution to be clear.
We want right. We want to be safe in our lives. We still want that conservative ideal. A lot of people don't realize it's a conservative ideal, to live lives that best suit us without having - without being attacked and without needing to deal with people like Harvey Weinstein and Bill Clinton.
CARLSON: I think that's exactly right. And it has been at least the Bronze Age since people are allowed to do whatever they wanted against their will.
BRUCE: The pulling by someone's hair, it's kind of. Yes.
CARLSON: Not a modern thing.
BRUCE: No.
CARLSON: So, you may have seen the rant at the Tony Awards by actor Robert de Niro, who followed up by apologizing to Canada for the American president. He's part of what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ROBERT DE NIRO, ACTOR: And I just wanted to make a note of apology for the idiotic behavior of my president. It's a disgrace and I apologize to Justin Trudeau and the other people at the G7. It's disgusting.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: When you find yourself apologizing to Canadians, it's by definition a new low. Then the president tweeted this in response.
""Robert De Niro, a very Low IQ individual, has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies. I watched him last night and truly believe he may be ""punch-drunk."" I guess he doesn't realize the economy is the best it's ever been with employment being at an all-time high, and many companies pouring back into our country. Wake up Punchy!""
Tammy?
BRUCE: He snuck that in between North Korea tweets, right? The world is changing. He's bringing world peace. And he managed to get that in there about Uncle Punchy.
Look, Robert de Niro's next movie is ""War with Grandpa"". And I think that you have gone from really ""Raging Bull"" to whining grandpa at this point. It's a shame. Fabulous actor, an American icon that has really declined.
And, really, it seems that - with a lot of people, I think there is jealousy that is rooted in the attacks on the president. And there you've got with that thing he is doing there with his arms. This is a man who seems to not be secure within his own manhood.
And that the president's success is upsetting him. And it is, I think, a lot of people. But for the American people in general, we appreciate the success. Securing the future of this country, saving lives - he said about North Korea today. If he can save 30 million people, of course, you'd stand on a stage with this guy.
It's ironic. They accused the president of being indecent when they every day show their own indecency. And the American people see this for what it is, I think.
CARLSON: Everything is irony, for sure. Tammy, great to see you. Thank you.
BRUCE: Thanks for having me.
CARLSON: Up next, a follow-up to what is a pretty amazing story out of the FAA. The FAA, we told you last week, has created a new test for selecting air traffic controllers that gives points for relevant criteria.
Well, it turns out the FAA has also been cavalier about cheating on that test. Our investigation of the government's dangerous hiring practices continues. After the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Well, we told you repeatedly over the last couple of weeks about how the FAA, which is in charge of your safety when you travel by air, has altered its merit-based hiring testing for air traffic controllers, adding a bogus biographical questionnaire to the process.
The new test existence is bad enough. They are seeking out the unqualified intentionally. But even more worrisome than that is the fact that the FAA apparently didn't care if people cheated on their already watered-down test.
In 2016, the Department of Transportation found that the National Black Coalition of Federal Aviation Employees had given its members guidance on how to answer the biographical questionnaire, so they could pass it.
In other words, the group helped them cheat by giving them the correct answers ahead of time. Cheating on a federal hiring test is a crime, and it ought to be. And yet, despite that, nobody was ever charged. In fact, one union member connected to the cheating appears to be still employed by the FAA.
Michael Pearson is a former air traffic controller. He's an attorney and he's involved in litigation surrounding the FAA's hiring practices. He joins us tonight.
Michael Pearson, thanks a lot for coming on. First, this is such a strong allegation that I want to get to how you know this to be absolutely true.
MICHAEL PEARSON, FORMER AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER: Well, I've been involved in this since it actually began when I first heard about it, with the purging of the list of folks that were watching your shoulder.
Remember that you had thousands of people on the list that were qualified, including with military experience and aviation experience. It all of a sudden was purged, in the FAA's words, and then folks were forced to go through this biographical questionnaire, which was designed by an outside vendor.
And so, for the last several years, including litigation that my firm, along with Mountain States Legal Foundation, brought, we have been able to dig up information through the Freedom of Information Act process as well as the litigation process.
So, not only do we have internal people tell us this was going on, that they were afraid that if they would come forward, the FAA would penalize them, the DOT would penalize them at fairly high levels of the government. But now we have actual documentary evidence that substantiates our worst fears.
CARLSON: So, the union helped people cheat on the test. Again, just to put this in context, to become air traffic controllers and control commercial aviation. Millions use it every year. People could die as a result of this. And yet, no one was ever charged for that. Why?
PEARSON: Well, it wasn't the union. It wasn't the Air Traffic Controllers' Union. It was NBCFAE, it's an employee, the National Black Coalition of Federal Aviation Employees, certainly did that. And it was a process started from early 2012, 2013.
There was a group within that organization who determined that the makeup of the workforce was too white. They wanted to get a more diverse workforce. They started lobbying through the political process, which they are certainly allowed to.
However, they then crafted this BQ exam, which not - it's not a screening test. It actually turned out that the scoring group actually penalized people with aviation experience of pilots, air traffic controllers.
And then, to make it worse, they had folks stand in line for this test that someone in the NBCFAA had apparently gotten the answers to and coached other people how to pass the test.
So, not only were our best and brightest, as the FAA says, actually purged off the list, they then were forced through a screening process that discriminated against them intentionally on the scoring of the test, so most, if not the great, great majority of them, failed that exam, while people were given the answers on how to pass the test.
Even more important, recent documents show that when this individual was interviewed, he'd given a written statement saying that he didn't do that. Then he went to a verbal interview with a DOT OIG criminal Investigator, said he didn't do it. He had his attorney with him.
Incredibly, the DOT OIG investigator allowed him to see witness statements contradicting that, and then allowed him to go out of the room with his attorney, come back in and change his story. That's just not done.
Anybody in law enforcement or the law - from the legal side, from an attorney's side or a criminal investigation side knows that that's beyond unusual. That's crafting an investigation to meet a predetermined outcome, i.e. nothing went wrong.
This investigation was started due to people like Frank LoBiondo, Randy Hultgren, members of Congress on both sides of the aisle that were concerned about this process, and the DOT OIG investigator's final result - or, basically, his suggestion or his recommendation was that this not be forwarded to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation.
This thing started at the high level, the DOT. It's a coverup at the very highest level. And you have all people - people involved from both the DOT and FAA.
And ironically enough, the architects, the implementers and the facilitators are still employed at high levels within the FAA.
CARLSON: And I never say this, but these are people who should be in prison because they're imperiling public safety on a mass scale.
PEARSON: At the very least, Tucker, what should happen is that DOJ, along with the FBI, should investigate what really went on and what really occurred and then the due process of the law should be followed.
And the folks in the FAA at the highest management levels that designed this, the architects, implementers and certainly the facilitators should be brought to justice. As you say, it's both civilly and criminally illegal to do what happened here.
CARLSON: The air traffic control system in the country - you're basically third world at that point. I mean, if you can't maintain high standards of air traffic control, then it's over.
Michael Pearson, thank you for that.
PEARSON: You're very welcome, Tucker.
CARLSON: Great to see you. That's about it for us tonight. Tune in every night at 8 p.m. to the show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.
Good night from Washington.
