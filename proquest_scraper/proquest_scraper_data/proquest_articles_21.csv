"Crain Communications, Incorporated","United States, New York","Jun 1, 2020",Council's worker-rights bills running out of time and losing support: The City Council has yet to schedule a vote on the Essential Workers Bill of Rights,"A progressive package of bills to protect front-line workers, announced to much fanfare in April, is gathering dust in the City Council as time is running out to pass the measures.
As the city edges closer to reopening, the council has yet to schedule a vote on the Essential Workers Bill of Rights package, which would expand sick leave, mandate hazard pay and offer whistleblower protections to essential employees.
The council's Committee on Civil Service and Labor is reviewing the legislation as part of the normal process, officials say, but the clock is running out.
The city will start opening up in the first or second week of June, Mayor Bill de Blasio said May 22. That move could make some parts of the Covid-19 relief package, which is meant specifically for those working while the rest of the city is shut down, inapplicable. Other parts of the legislation are already set to expire once the pandemic is over.
City Council Speaker Corey Johnson has changed his tune on one of the most controversial bills in the package—hazard pay. The legislation, which the speaker co-sponsored, gave bonus pay—between $30 and $75 per shift—to essential workers during the pandemic.
When Johnson introduced the package alongside City Councilmen Ben Kallos and Brad Lander and Majority Leader Laurie Cumbo at a late April news conference, he said hazard pay and other bills were meant to provide substantive support to essential workers.
""This is about protecting these workers, not just through our words,"" Johnson said at the time.
Another news conference with Elizabeth Warren, who supported the measure, followed in early May.
Backpedaling
When pressed on the legislation at a virtual town hall on May 19, Johnson backpedaled on his support.
""It was a way to start that conversation,"" Johnson said of hazard pay. ""We did not pass the bill recently, and we need to see what happens on the federal level that will inform what we think about these things moving forward.""
But between the news conferences and that town hall was a seven-hour hearing on the relief package. At the marathon meeting, businesses, nonprofits and city agency heads testified that hazard pay would be an unmanageable burden on their budgets.
Lander and Kallos, two sponsors of the package, told Crain's they are still working to set up votes on the sick leave and whistleblower bills, even as the deadline for reopening the economy approaches.
""It will be more important than ever to have protections for those on the front line of reopening,"" Kallos said. The Manhattan councilman said he's working to amend the whistleblower bill to apply to future pandemics—otherwise, it would expire in September, when Gov. Andrew Cuomo's executive order on the coronavirus is lifted.
But concerns raised by businesses may well have given Democratic members of the City Council cold feet on the progressive package.
""I would say that the bill has lost some of its momentum,"" said Councilman Barry Grodenchik, who represents Queens. ""The [business] owners have made it clear to us that it would be very, very, expensive.""
Neither he nor any of the half-dozen council members who spoke to Crain's were aware of plans to schedule votes on the package.
""I'm all for worker protection. I think there are a lot of workers who deserve to have protection,"" said Councilman Donovan Richards, who represents Queens and the Rockaways. But he's noticed more rental signs cropping up in storefronts in his district.
""It's just a complicated formula,"" Richards said.
""It may not be the right legislation,"" Bronx Councilman Andy King said about hazard pay. ""I'm a little concerned about the numbers—when I read $30 and $75, that's a lot to put on some of our small supermarkets.""
Lawmakers have still enacted other measures to respond to Covid-19. Last week de Blasio signed seven council bills into law meant to provide relief to restaurants, tenants and small businesses.
City Council leaders will hold off on scheduling votes until they have enough numbers to pass the bill, multiple council members told Crain's.
That will take more time, council spokeswoman Jennifer Fermino said.
""This bill is going through the legislative process. We had a seven-hour-long hearing as well as hundreds of pages of written testimony that are being reviewed,"" she said.
In doing so, that could run out the clock—a risk King is willing to take.
""I can't say if it comes to a vote today that I'd be voting,"" the councilman said. ""Maybe we sit back and don't try to regulate it now.""

The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC,"United States, New York","Feb 1, 2019","Two LGBT Rights Bills Were Just Killed In Virginia, But The Battle Isn't Over: Two LGBT rights bills, around housing and public employment, were just killed in Virginia's House of Delegates. But the coalition to change hearts and minds may ultimately prevail.","The first month of 2019 delivered several key LGBT victories, like a transgender rights law in New York, and protective executive orders in several Midwestern states.
But at the tail end of January, LGBT advocates have suffered a major loss in Virginia, where two critical LGBT rights bills were just killed in the state’s House of Delegates.
The bills in question, HB 2677 and HB 2067, would have protected LGBT Virginians from discrimination in the areas of housing and public employment, respectively. They were both scheduled to be heard in the House General Laws Committee on Thursday, but the day before, LGBT advocates discovered they were no longer on the agenda.

“We’re really disappointed that at the eleventh hour, the bills were pulled out of committee and might not get the full and fair hearing they deserve,” Masen Davis, CEO of Freedom for All Americans, told The Daily Beast.
As The Daily Beast previously reported, LGBT advocates were gearing up for a major win in Virginia, where the House of Delegates has long stood in the way of these sought-after protections, despite receiving the approval of the Virginia Senate for four years running. Democrats have been narrowing the Republican lead in the House—and LGBT advocates were hopeful that they could find bipartisan support there this year.
In mid-January, the Senate once again approved housing and public employment protections in bipartisan votes of 33-7 and 28-12, respectively. The Human Rights Campaign and other LGBT rights groups celebrated the win, highlighting the fact that public opinion polls conducted by two different firms—Mason-Dixon and the Terrance Group—found a majority of Republican voters in the state were largely in favor of LGBT protections in these two areas.
But come Thursday, the twin bills were not listed on the House General Laws Committee’s docket, prompting LGBT groups to gather outside the state house for a rally. In a statement, HRC National Field Director Marty Rouse called the move “shameful.”
Now, LGBT advocates are calling on Republican House Speaker Kirk Cox to bring the bills to the floor for a vote before the legislative session ends on February 23.
“It’s a very short session in Virginia, so time is short, but there are still a few more days where the Speaker could realize that the majority of Virginians are for this bill,” Davis told The Daily Beast.
“It’s time for the House of Delegates to finally take up and pass these bills,” said James Parrish, executive director for Equality Virginia, in a statement. “It’s not controversial; it’s common sense.”
Speaker Cox did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment.
Virginia is home to over 200,000 LGBT Americans. The Movement Advancement Project, which ranks LGBT equality in all 50 states on a scale from “negative” to “high,” currently ranks Virginia as “low,”based in large part on its lack of non-discrimination protections for LGBT people.
Currently, no Eastern states below the Mason-Dixon Line have a ranking higher than “low” except for Maryland, Virginia’s neighbor to the north.
In January 2017, outgoing Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe did sign an executive order protecting LGBT state employees from discrimination—and in January 2018, incoming governor Ralph Northam, also a Democrat, signed a similar and slightly more expansive executive order.
But legislation protecting public employees would be more permanent because LGBT executive orders can be rolled back. (Kansas, for example, first had an executive order protecting LGBT state employees in 2007, but it was rescinded in 2015, only to be reinstated in 2018.)
Equality Virginia, a statewide LGBT advocacy group, has pledged to “keep fighting for the community” in the wake of this week’s defeat. Davis, for one, is holding out hope that Speaker Cox could still “change his mind.”
At this point, however LGBT groups primarily seem to be looking ahead to November, when state elections could once again shake up the composition of the House of Delegates. If the 2019 election results in Virginia follow 2018’s voting patterns, as the Washington Post observed last November, Democrats could end up with a commanding 61-39 majority in the House of Delegates.
That would make the passage of both bills a shoo-in.
“If current leaders cowardly refuse to protect all Virginians, then voters will elect lawmakers who will,” said Rouse in a statement. “We will remember this in November.”
Davis is confident that, barring a sudden reversal this year from Speaker Cox, next year will be a different story. He sees Virginia as a case study in building bipartisan support for LGBT rights—the same support “that we’re starting to see across the country.”
“The truth is that even if we don’t win this year in Virginia, we are seeing the coalition working in that state, effectively changing hearts and minds, building support from incredibly diverse parts of the community across Virginia—and we know that that’s what’s needed to finally get us across the finish line in the state,” he told The Daily Beast.
LGBT advocates may have lost this year. But perhaps the fifth time’s a charm.
