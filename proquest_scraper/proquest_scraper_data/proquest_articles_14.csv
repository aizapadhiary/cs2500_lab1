POLITICO LLC,"United States, Arlington","Jul 12, 2019",The Trump Bill of Rights,"President Donald Trump came close to rewriting the First Amendment while speaking to the kennel’s worth of right-wing lapdogs, trolls, conspiracy theorists and media hackers he convened at the White House on Thursday for his “Social Media Summit.”
Saying that Google, Facebook and Twitter were guilty of “discriminating against conservatives,” Trump vowed that “all regulatory and legislative solutions” available to the federal government would be used against the companies “to protect free speech.”
Rather than defining free speech in positive terms, Trump explained what free speech isn’t. “To me free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposefully write bad,” Trump said. “To me that’s very dangerous speech and you become angry at it. But that’s not free speech.”
If Trump thinks negative and critical commentary don’t qualify as free speech because they’re “dangerous” and make him “angry,” he’s reversed the First Amendment, which was designed to protect the right to say bad things about “good” things. It’s easy to imagine that Trump’s complete revision of the First Amendment would define freedom of religion as the right to attend a church of Trump’s choice, that the right to assembly was reserved only for people attending MAGA rallies, and that the freedom of the press belongs to those who praise Trump.
Following Trump’s idea to its logical extremes, what would the Bill of Rights look like if he applied the same judicial oomph to the other original amendments to the Constitution? Rewriting the Second Amendment to Trump's satisfaction could be done with just a few word changes. Rather than having a right to bear arms, the Trump rewrite would make gun ownership a duty. This isn’t far from Trump’s real-life position. In a June interview, he all but called for universal armament when he said that unarmed civilians were “sitting ducks.”
The Third Amendment, which forbids the military from using citizens’ homes as crash pads without consent, is the least controversial of all the amendments. Trump, who worships the military, could own the libs with a rewrite stating that the soldiers working on the Mexican border must lodge in nearby private residences. Homeowners who find themselves overcrowded by their military lodgers would be allowed to temporarily reside in our luxurious and spacious migrant detention centers.
Given the fury he directed at special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI for their investigations, I imagine that Trump would fork the Fourth Amendment into a two-parter. His enemies would have no protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. If you haven’t done anything wrong, you have nothing to hide. But searches directed against obviously innocent people like Trump and his associates would be forbidden. Remember his wailing in April 2018, after the FBI served a lawful search warrant on his then-attorney, Michael Cohen? Trump characterized the search, which helped secure a guilty plea from Cohen, as worse than a break-in. “It's an attack on our country,” Trump said. “It’s an attack on what we all stand for.”
Trump’s Fifth Amendment makeover would likely toss the “takings” clause. He's a long-term abuser of eminent domain; he believes that property owners have no right to keep their homes and businesses when he wants to buy them. But what to do about the right against self-incrimination enshrined in the amendment? Keep it as is? Maybe the best way out would be to privatize self-incrimination rights by allowing individuals to sign binding nondisclosure agreements with themselves.
The Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial would be reversed, informed by Trump’s history of dragging his feet in civil cases. Trump loves to sue, and because he’s such a deadbeat, his contractors tend to sue him back. The way Trump sees it, the longer the litigation, the greater chance his opponent will back down. In the famous Tesoro case, Trump’s attorney told architect Andrew Tesoro that he might win the lawsuit he had filed against Trump, but the mogul would make certain the case would last so long that he’d go bankrupt in the process.
The Seventh Amendment, which guarantees civil jury trials in federal court, would probably attract no interest from Trump. But the Eighth, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment would be trash-canned. He’s a proponent of torture, water boarding and other methods of “enhanced interrogation,” saying it “works.” In 1989, he called for the death penalty after a group of teenagers was charged with a Central Park rape. (The teenagers were later exonerated.)
I will leave Trumpian reformation of the Ninth Amendment, which Judge Robert Bork once compared to an impenetrable “inkblot,” to legal scholars. The Ninth might be the only Bill of Rights amendment in dire need of actual freshening, Trump or no Trump. It’s unlikely that Trump would take issue with the Tenth, which establishes the concept of federalism. So instead of rewriting the last two amendments, the unshackled Trump would probably award himself the wild card of an additional amendment to the Bill of Rights. Its wording: “If an incumbent president loses office in a reelection campaign, he shall not be removed from the White House without his consent.”

WP Company LLC d/b/a The Washington Post,"United States, Washington, D.C.","Jun 1, 2017",Md. gerrymandering lawsuit could impact 2018 voting map: The plaintiffs' attorneys have asked a federal court to quickly declare the existing map unconstitutional or bar state officials from enforcing it for the 2018 election.,"Seven individuals challenging Maryland's 6th Congressional District as unconstitutional are asking a federal court to overturn the state's voting map or block officials from using it in the 2018 election.
John Benisek, a resident of Williamsport, and other residents allege that gerrymandering by Maryland Democrats during the 2010-2011 redistricting process violated their First Amendment rights, diminishing the ability of Republicans to elect candidates of their choice for the congressional seat now held by Rep. John Delaney (D).
Plaintiffs' attorneys deposed some of the state's leading Democrats, including former governor Martin O'Malley, who said he felt a responsibility to make the seat more winnable for Democrats. The seat was held at the time by Roscoe Bartlett (R), and O'Malley led the redistricting effort.
On Wednesday, the attorneys filed a motion asking a three-judge panel with the U.S. District Court in Maryland to declare the map unconstitutional or issue a preliminary injunction blocking the state from enforcing it, arguing that ""any further delay risks irreparable injury with respect to the forthcoming 2018 election.""
The plaintiffs are arguing that Democratic state officials who designed the district relied heavily on advanced mapping software, voter-registration data and voting history to give an advantage to their party.
When asked whether he thought the revised district would help Democrats, O'Malley said in his deposition that it ""was certainly my hope, and it was part of my intent.""
O'Malley said state legislative leaders who took part in the redistricting process, including House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) and Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert), had the same intentions.
But Miller and Busch, in their depositions, said they did not seek to flip the district to the Democratic column. ""I voted for and supported what I would believe was in the best interest of the citizens of the state,"" Busch said.
Miller and Busch said they were largely unfamiliar with the data given to their staffs during the redistricting process, including metrics showing the chances of Democrats winning districts under various configurations.
""I didn't even review it,"" Miller said. ""It wasn't important to me.""
In redrawing the 6th Congressional District, state officials moved more than 360,000 residents out of the district and a roughly equal number of people into it.
Before the change, Republicans made up nearly 47 percent of registered eligible voters within the boundaries, compared with about 36 percent for Democrats. After the new lines were enacted, Republicans made up 33 percent of registered eligible voters in the district, compared with 44 percent for Democrats.
The Cook Political Report's partisan voter index, which estimates the propensity for districts to vote Democratic or Republican, showed that the 6th Congressional District flipped from an R+13 in 2010 to a D+2 in 2011, the largest swing in the nation that year.
""There is no plausible explanation for the wholesale geographic, demographic, and political reshuffling of the Sixth District other than the attempt to dilute Republican votes to make it impossible for them to reelect Roscoe Bartlett,"" the plaintiffs' attorneys said.
Bartlett, who had consistently won reelection in the district by double-digit margins over two decades, lost the 2012 election to Delaney.
The result gave Democrats seven of Maryland's eight congressional seats. They previously controlled six.
The plaintiffs' attorneys claim that many constituents in and around the 6th District have been ""chilled from participating in the political process, not only because they feel that voting is a lost cause in light of gerrymandering, but also because they feel disconnected from their congressional district.""
During the depositions, Miller was asked about talking points his staff had provided for various speaking engagements at Democratic events. One of the items said the revised 6th District ""gives Democrats a real opportunity to pick up a seventh seat in the delegation by targeting Roscoe Bartlett.""
Another memo said: ""If asked about redistricting, keep it simple. We're going to do our best to help Democrats, while following all of the applicable federal and state constitutional and statutory requirements.""
Miller played down the talking points, saying he generally speaks off the cuff during speeches. He described the notes as ""political rhetoric"" designed to inspire Democrats and not necessarily guiding principles for the redistricting process.
The case is Benisek v. Lamone.

CQ Roll Call,"United States, Atlanta","Feb 6, 2017","Interview With Kellyanne Conway; A Visit to the Border; Confrontation With Iran, U.S. Tensions with Iran Examined; President Trump Criticizes Media; Super Bowl Reviewed","(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
SEAN HANNITY, HOST (voice-over): Tonight. The legal battle over President Trump's temporary travel ban continues. Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway is here with reaction.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The border is soft and weak. Drugs are pouring in. And I'm not going to let that happen.
HANNITY: Then, our ""Hannity"" producers did a ride-long the Border Patrol to see how bad things really are today on our southern border. Geraldo Rivera weighs in.
TRUMP: The men and women of the United States military -- they're the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the earth.
HANNITY: And President Trump outlines his vision for America's military, and also the looming showdown ratcheting up with Iran. We'll check in with Colonel Oliver North and he'll react.
TRUMP: Much of the media, not all of it, is very, very dishonest.
HANNITY: Plus, President Trump fights back against endless smears from the abusively biased press. Larry Elder, Mercedes Schlapp respond,
""Hannity"" starts right here, right now.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: And welcome to ""Hannity."" A fierce legal battle is brewing over President Donald Trump's extreme vetting executive order as liberals and the left continue to be willing to gamble with the lives of you, the American people. And that is tonight's ""Opening Monologue.""
So the legal back and forth is complete and total nonsense because we shouldn't even be at this point in the first place. And here's why. Now, this is a classic example of activist judges ruling based on their own personal opinions and not on what the law actually says -- judicial activism -- because if you look at the U.S. code that pertains to President Trump's executive action -- let me put it up on the screen.
It reads, quote, "" Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the U.S. would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants, non-immigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions that he may deem to be appropriate.""
Now, Daniel Horowitz, our friend over at Conservative Review -- he wrote an article entitled ""Rogue judges undermining our sovereignty, and here's how Congress can stop them."" Now, in it, Horowitz argues that the judiciary branch of our governor, especially on the lower levels, has been utterly polluted by progressive judges who decide rulings that are based on personal or political opinions, not on the law, not on standing, not on the Constitution.
So in other words, a lawsuit can be brought before a liberal judge -- they can go judge shopping -- or in a liberal-leaning court, and it can have a national impact, like what we are seeing playing out. Now, according to Horowitz, Congress should work to take back their power from these activist courts in order to protect you, the American people, our sovereignty and the rule of law.
Now, for example, the U.S. 9th circuit court of appeals, where this legal battle is now playing out, is known by all to be the most liberal federal appeals court in the country. And if you look at the Seattle-based federal judge, James Robart, who put a temporary halt to the president's extreme vetting executive order on Friday, well, he has a history of questionable rulings. And according to The Seattle Times, during a hearing last year on police reform, well, Judge Robart -- he declared, quote, ""black lives matter, and of course, all lives matter.""
And then there is the out-of-control liberal hypocrisy that is on full display here. For example, Senator Chuck Schumer -- he's calling foul over the president's executive order, but what the Senator is not telling you, that back in 2015, he actually said a pause on admitting refugees into the country could be necessary.
Then there's the two most recent Democratic presidents. They argued in favor of tougher immigration laws. Let's take a look at Bill Clinton. This was back in 1995 during a State of the Union address. Take a look.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BILL CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All Americans, not only in the state's most heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.
We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Nation of immigrants, nation of laws. It's self-defeating. Doesn't that sound a lot like President Trump now. It does, right? Now, of course, back when President Clinton said it, there was collective outrage from the left? Never happened.
And if that's not enough for liberals, there's also President Obama. This is him back in 2014 saying this. Let's look at more hypocrisy.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Today, our immigration system is broken and everybody knows it. Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we're also a nation of laws. Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable. If you're a criminal, you'll be deported. If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up.
The actions I'm taking are not only lawful, they're the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and ever single Democratic president for the past half century. And to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer. Pass a bill.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: Wow. There you have it. Now, the only reason liberals are resisting President Trump's action on extreme vetting is they're trying to score cheap political points. Now, it doesn't matter that President Obama and Congress came up -- they're the ones that came up with the list of seven countries that President Trump referred to in his executive order. And liberals -- they don't seem to mind one bit that according to The New York Post, visa holders from these seven countries that have ties to terror and extremism are now rushing into the country while they can, thanks to the courts.
Now, President Trump's policy is very straightforward. Instead of twisting and misrepresenting Donald Trump's intentions, well, the left should listen very closely to what the president said earlier today. Listen closely, especially if you're a liberal.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: We need strong programs so that people that love us and want to love our country and will end up loving our country are allowed in, not people that want to destroy us and destroy our country.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: My message to the left tonight is very clear. You want to keep playing games, you go right ahead. But know this. If one American loses their life, is killed as a result of letting in dangerous, unvetted people into this country, you are to blame and you will have blood on your hands and you can explain that to the American people why you put politics ahead of their safety.
Earlier today, I spoke to the special counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway, and here's what she said.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: Kellyanne, good to see you.
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Hi.
HANNITY: You know, you look at the history of all this, seems to be to be all politics, great hypocrisy on display. What if somebody that is not vetted is killed (sic) in the meantime? What does that mean? Are they willing to gamble with American lives?
CONWAY: Well, this is the president's entire point, Sean. He has a right, he has a responsibility, the authority, and indeed, the duty to protect Americans, and that's what he's trying to do here.
The statute that you read, the past comments from liberals like President Obama and President Bill Clinton are very closely aligned with what President Trump is trying to do now as our commander-in-chief and president.
We find that the particular order coming out of the Seattle judge is overly broad. It's a nationwide injunction. He referenced religion, when, in fact, that has nothing to do with the executive order. It's not in there. And the fact is that we don't even know if these states that sued have standing. Individuals have standing and individuals usually need to show harm and damages.
HANNITY: You know, the other thing is the total dishonesty here. I'm going to put up on the country -- on the screen, 43 countries, OK, majority Muslim countries representing 90 percent of the world's Muslims are not included in the ban, including Indonesia, 258 million Muslims, Egypt 95 million, Bangladesh 156 million, Pakistan 201 million.
But the news media keeps saying it's something it's not. That's got to be frustrating when they say it's a litmus test, as Chuck Todd has said, a religious test or a Muslim ban. What is your reaction to the false reporting?
CONWAY: Well, the reaction is that President Obama himself said that these same seven countries needed special screening. They weren't just picked out of a hat. They are -- they were actually designated by President Obama and the Congress as needed special screening. They have a tradition and history of training, harboring and exporting terrorists. And we've seen that.
And I know there's article that's not getting much play today that I really want to call to everybody's attention. It's in the Associated Press by Eric Tucker. And he basically fact checked Judge -- the judge in Seattle, Judge Robart, and said the judge was incorrect when he said that no one has been arrested for extremism under this kind of...
HANNITY: I pointed that out on my radio show. That's -- you're exactly right.
CONWAY: Well, I appreciate that. And this is such an important thing for everybody to know because the judge from the bench had asked the attorney how many people have actually been arrested under this type of order, and she said, I don't know. And he said, I'll tell you, zero. And that's just not true. And I'm sure that everybody can look at Eric Tucker, Associated Press. I don't hear the media covering this. This should be the biggest story of the day in that -- especially since...
HANNITY: He was wrong!
CONWAY: ... they're -- you know, he was wrong, but he did it from the bench. You know, all of us are wrong once in a while, Sean, and we apologize and immediately rectify it, but this is the judge who then said that the -- issued a nationwide injunction from the bench in Seattle in the 9th circuit...
HANNITY: Yes.
CONWAY: ... and was just wrong from the bench in what he said about what this type of extreme vetting would provide or could have prevented had it been in place earlier.
HANNITY: You know, Kellyanne, there are many countries that if you have an Israeli passport, they don't -- Muslim countries that do not let you in their country just because you have an Israeli passport. I want to put up on the screen and show you something. This...
CONWAY: That sounds like a religious test.
HANNITY: Yes, that does sound like a religious test.
CONWAY: And this is not.
HANNITY: Democracy matters strategic plan for action. This was discovered by The Washington Free Beacon. It involves David Brock. And inside this memo, it has plans for defeating Trump, A, through impeachment, through government misinformation, the midterm elections, and more importantly, filing lawsuits against the Trump administration.
So that's pretty much telling me that they're going to judge shop for the next four years to defeat the administration on every agenda item. How do you combat that?
CONWAY: You combat it by doing what the president's already doing, which is and showing progress and solutions and forward-moving action on behalf of people, and then they'll get it. They'll see who is against them. They'll see who's actually making a positive difference in their lives. In just the first two weeks on the job, this man has boosted wages, created jobs, opened up the pipelines, Dakota pipeline, Keystone pipeline, taken us out of TPP, made sure that factories that can stay here and not go to Mexico or workers going to -- or labor going to China, production going to China, that that stops.
He, of course, has met with manufacturing CEOs. He has reversed corrosive regulations that are hurting small business owners. You know, presidents are judged by their accomplishments over time and the real impact they've had on people. And Sean, I can't tell you, for all the negativity out there towards the president and towards all of us here at the White House how many more people across this country write us, text us, e-mail us, call us, stop us wherever we are and just say, Thank you. Thank you for trying to make a difference. Thank you for taking the fire and making a difference.
Now, if the professional left wants to continue with this permanent campaign and never actually accept the results that this is everyone's president and he is trying to do good for everyone, then they'll have to -- then people can judge for themselves.
I mean, I think the left is not off to a really good start. They sound like a bunch of crybabies.
HANNITY: They are crybabies.
CONWAY: And speaking of hypocrisy -- speaking of hypocrisy, what about all these Democratic senators who voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to a federal appeals court...
HANNITY: Unanimously.
CONWAY: ... already 10 years ago? What's changed now except for politics? So the hypocrisy there -- the American people can see that. They can see what these protesters are really saying, what they're really about, and they can judge for themselves. They can protest. Here at the White House, we're going to make progress.
HANNITY: All right, Kellyanne, great to see you, as always. Thank you for taking time.
CONWAY: Thank you, Sean.
HANNITY: I know you're busy every day.
Now, coming up, a ""Hannity"" special investigation. We sent our cameras down to ride along with the Border Patrol this weekend. Look at what they found, among many things, 400 pounds of drugs. That's coming up next. We'll also get reaction from Geraldo.
And also tonight...

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
(NEWSBREAK)
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TRUMP: Mexico with the United States has out-negotiated us and beat us to a pulp through out past leaders. They've made us look foolish. We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico. On top of that, the border is soft and weak. Drugs are pouring in. And I'm not going to let that happen.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HANNITY: All right, that was President Trump vowing to stop the cartel- fueled drugs and violence from pouring into our country from Mexico. So the question is, just how bad is the situation down at the southern border? Now, last week, we sent one of our producer to Arizona to check it out for you, and what they found once again is shocking. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How far south are you?
AGENT VINCENTE PACO, U.S. BORDER PATROL: We have (INAUDIBLE) type of fencing here that allows us to see through the fence and address any threats that might be approaching the fence. This is where the pedestrian fencing ends. We're about five miles west of the city of (INAUDIBLE) .
The terrain in this location is, as you can see, is very rugged.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This here is referred to as a vehicle barrier. This used to be a known drive-through location where we have vehicles driving through. And right here is evidence that there's a lot of traffic through here.
This is a known drug smuggling route. There is evidence that drug mules come through this area because you can see that there's these bundle straps. These bundle straps here are used to tie the bundles together, and then they're -- you know, they put them up like that and make them into, like, small backpacks.
For somebody to walk all the way this way, they probably already walked a day in Mexico before they cross into the United States because there's really no towns out here.
Right now, we're about a mile southeast of Aho (ph), Arizona. So we had air support, picked up a group of suspected drug mules in the area. One agent interdicted a group, and he has contraband with him. While agents were responding, one of the agents came across what seems to be abandoned marijuana.
Doesn't look like it's part of a group we're working, but sometimes we get close to the area and drug mules abandon their load and then they run back to Mexico to avoid apprehension.
Each of these barrels weighs around 50 pounds. Thee are about 20 kilos a pack.
What we're going to do right now is we're going to try to get close to assist the other agent that they need right now. You know, we don't know if they're outstanding individuals. The good thing is that we got air support nearby (INAUDIBLE) going to try find a safe zone to land in and help them out with that.
By the time the agents showed up because they were up in the mountains, the smugglers have dropped their contraband. Good thing that we had air assets nearby where they were able to go respond and assist in the search of the bundles. So what we're going to do right now is we're going to break them down individually. Then we're going to tag them. We're going to weigh each one of Them.
Agents are weighing, breaking down the bundles individually. They're tagging them. What's going to happen from here is they're going to get eventually turned over to the Drug Enforcement Agency who ultimately takes custody of the contraband. Once we interdict it, the group -- the agents exhausted all resources available to look for the individuals. But you know, more than likely that they made their way back into Mexico once we -- once they knew we were moving into their location. As you can tell, they have the high ground when we were driving in, so they saw us moving into their location.
We interdicted a total of 18 bundles of contraband with a total weight of over 400 pounds of marijuana, these 400 pounds that are not going to make it into the streets today.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
HANNITY: 400 pounds caught in that raid alone. Joining us now with reaction to what you just saw, FOX News senior correspondent Geraldo Rivera.
All right, I have been down 12 times -- horseback, all-terrain vehicle, boats, helicopters. Me on horseback was funny by the way. I have been to drug warehouses. I was there when gangs were arrested, gang members were arrested -- have it all on video. And the drug warehouse, floor to ceiling, the biggest warehouse you've ever seen.
Isn't this issue also not about the drugs and the cartels and the gang?. What if they were terrorists? What if they were bringing in nuclear material?
GERALDO RIVERA, FOX CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's an excellent question. I just want to compliment the producer. I don't know which one...
HANNITY: Dan Comb (ph).
RIVERA: Dan Comb. Well, congratulations to him because it's one thing to talk about drugs being smuggled, it's another thing to see the vivid graphic evidence of it right before your very eyes.
In terms of the wall -- and I think that's where the conversation has to go. I think the wall will stop casual drug dealers. It'll stop the pot smuggler. The question is whether it will stop the El Chapos. Remember, there are 75 tunnels that have been identified over the 2,000-mile border, 75...
HANNITY: I was in one. I was in one
RIVERA: And of course, I was in El Chapo's...
HANNITY: Right.
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: I remember that, yes.
RIVERA: I think the pros will fly over it. They'll tunnel under it. They'll drive around it. I think it will stop the small-timers. And of course, now, as the United States legalizes pot and produce so much of our own now, I think that demand will drop...
HANNITY: Are you...
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Aren't you worried more about the heroin, the kids that try vicodin, percocet, oxycontin, and then move to heroin?
RIVERA: Go back to what you said earlier about national security and terrorists sneaking across. As far as I know, there has not yet been a verified penetration of our southern border by any terrorist, not yet. Thank God.
HANNITY: I don't believe that.
RIVERA: All I know is what the record...
(CROSSTALK)
HANNITY: Here's what we do now.
RIVERA: Not yet.
RIVERA: We have a thousand ongoing investigations of radical Islamists in all 50 states. That's just a fact. Where they came from, we don't know.
RIVERA: But did you notice there was a fence in most of the area that you were talking about. So would a fence twice as high work twice as well?
HANNITY: Double fencing...
HANNITY: I'm not so sure.
HANNITY: ... across most of the border, and then there are other techniques. Here's the thing...
RIVERA: You know, I withdrew my objection. I think that if...
HANNITY: I know you did.
RIVERA: If you're willing to spend, if the taxpayers of the United States...
HANNITY: No, Mexico's going to pay for it.
HANNITY: ... are willing to spend up to $25 billion...
HANNITY: Yes!
RIVERA: I think that we have to see now -- and the most interesting thing is within the Republican Party, people like Senator John Cornyn and others -- of Texas and others, are saying, or beginning to say, Wait. As infrastructure priorities go, this is not the top of our list. We have to really make sure that there's a spending offset, where the budget doesn't go to hell (INAUDIBLE)
HANNITY: That goes for all spending. And I know that's a priority, but national security's got to be the number one priority.
Up next tonight here on ""Hannity""...

TRUMP: For proof that our nation has been blessed by God, look no further than the men and women of the United States military. They are the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the earth and that the world has ever known. The challenges facing our nation nevertheless are very large, very, very large. We're up against an enemy that celebrates death and totally worships destruction. You've seen that.

HANNITY: Very true. That was President Trump earlier today. He was talking to CENTCOM and hew as at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, his first trip as commander-in-chief to the headquarters for the U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command.
During his speech, along with praising our fighting forces, President Trump promised that radical Islamic terrorism will be defeated. Here now with reaction, the host of ""War Stories"" Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North.
All right, Colonel, let me just lay out a history here because there is a new sheriff in town. I don't think the media is seeing what's going on. General Flynn puts Iran on notice. President Trump tweets out, it's -- I'm not Obama. He was way too kind. Then sanctions are put in place. Then the USS Cole is positioned off the coast of Yemen which would have pretty quick access to the Straits of Hormuz.
Very different from Obama, 100 -- $1.7 billion, paying ransom, allowing them to spin centrifuges, 25 days notice for inspections, no U.S. inspectors, not any place, any time.
If I'm the Iranians right now, I think I'm thinking they -- he is preparing to go after my nuclear sites. Am I reading this right or am I wrong?
OLIVER NORTH, ""WAR STORIES"" HOST: Well, he's certainly taken nothing off the table, Sean. And the fact is, add to that little list of things that are happening out in the part of the world, the George Herbert Walker Bush, CVN-67 -- its carrier strike group is now in the Mediterranean headed east, and that ought to give them something really to think about.
The sanctions that he started last Friday target 25 IRGC members. That's the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, their businesses, the individuals, the bank accounts. And it's aimed at the suppliers who are aiding and abetting Iran's ballistic missile program.
And you don't need a ballistic missile program unless you've got a nuclear weapons program. So these are individuals and entities who are procuring the technology and the materials to support the missile program, and it includes those -- and I quote -- ""acting on behalf of or providing support to the IRGC Quds Force, which is, of course, their special operations units that are rampant in Iraq, some in Syria, certainly some down in Yemen helping the Houthis. So these (ph) unilateral course of sanctions like those are generally ineffective because fewer if any of those 25 entities are doing any business in the U.S. But...
HANNITY: I assume...
NORTH: ... here's the good news.
HANNITY: Yes.
NORTH: Let me just -- good news. You can fix that with a very simple amendment. In seven days, all business and banks doing any business whatsoever with the aforementioned Iranian entities and/or similar entities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the DPRK, will be barred from doing any business in the United States. That will stop that program.
SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: The Iranian precipitated this by firing the ballistic missile tests that they had. Then they've been sabre rattling on top of that. We know Donald Trump doesn't want a protracted war, doesn't believe in a ground war. So we now have ourselves with a very complicated situation, a-squared, b-squared equals c-squares. Iranian Mullahs, the number one state sponsor of terror, if they get nuclear weapons, they said they will use them. Do you see a potential alliance with the United States, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, the Egyptians, Jordanians, and Israelis to take out nuclear sites that are very cleverly are spread all throughout Iran, many of them underground needing bunker busting bombs to get there. Do you think that that operation needs to be done? Whether or not they are planning or not, that's a different story. Should we take that action?
NORTH: I don't think we are going to have to.
HANNITY: Why?
NORTH: Quite frankly, if you look at what happened right after that deal was done in Vienna when Kerry announced it, King Salman in Saudi Arabia invited as guests for a conference El-Sisi from Egyptian, Abdullah from Jordan, Erdogan from Turkey, and Sharif from Pakistan. He also invited the two emirs from Abu Dhabi and Dubai. They all came except for Abdullah because he was targeted for assassination that day. He sent his chief of staff.
What was that meeting about? I'll tell you what it was about. Salman wants those weapons that he bought for the Pakistanis available to him. I think the mostly likely outcome of this is, one, an incredible proliferation of nuclear weapons around the rest of the world. That started with what Obama was doing. And number two, the kinds of things that might well lead to the cooperation that's now extant between the Israelis and the Saudis and the Sunni adversaries of the Shiite radicals in Tehran.
HANNITY: It's going to be it to watch this play out. I don't think people are paying close enough attention. This is ratcheting up quickly. All right, Colonel, good to see you, safe home.
And up next tonight right here on HANNITY.

HANNITY: That was President Trump talking about the alt left radical liberal mainstream media. However, President Trump's words have not stopped the relentless onslaught of smears coming from the biased leftwing press. Trump on Twitter this morning wrote, quote, ""Any negative polls are fake news just like CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting."" The president also tweeted, quote, ""The failing ""The New York Times"" writes total fiction concerning me. They have gotten it wrong for two years and are now making up stories and sources.""
Now, the consistently biased coverage from the mainstream media is a reason why according to a recent Q","Hannity, Sean; Rivera, Geraldo; North, Oliver",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/1865964509/citation/6D6959A2890C4A29PQ/4?accountid=12826
Gannett Media Corp,"United States, Des Moines, Iowa","Nov 29, 2018",Inmates suing for right to porn: 58 plaintiffs seek to overturn new state ban,"Fifty-eight Iowa inmates are suing state officials in federal court, seeking $25,000 each in damages, claiming they have been denied a constitutional right to pornography in the state's prison system.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Des Moines, seeks to overturn a new state law that has shut down designated ""pornography reading rooms"" in Iowa's prisons. The law also prohibits inmates from having nude photos in their cells. The ban includes Playboy magazine, which has long been allowed in the state's nine prisons, which hold 8,575 inmates.
The plaintiffs — who are all inmates at the Fort Dodge Correctional Facility — are led by Allen C. Miles, 70, who is serving a life sentence for the stabbing death of Cheryl Kleinschrodt on March 3, 1982, in Des Moines. The suit claims the law was enacted under the guise of ""morality,"" and blames ""religious tyrants"" who have no regard for the U.S. Constitution or Declaration of Independence.
The lawsuit also contends that if female correctional officers employed in Iowa's prisons for men can't handle an environment that includes photographic matter featuring female nudity and related matters that ""they should find employment elsewhere.""
The suit was filed in late October and the changes took effect Nov. 14. U.S. Judge Robert Pratt in Des Moines has ordered each of the plaintiffs to pay a filing fee or to request that the fee be waived. He also told them to file a new complaint no later than Friday for the case to proceed.
The legislation — approved by the Iowa House and Senate and signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds — was part of a justice system budget bill approved at the end of the 2018 session.
The new law specifically says funds appropriated to the Iowa Department of Corrections shall not be used to distribute or make available any commercially published information or material to an inmate that is sexually explicit or features nudity.
The law reverses a policy in place for three decades since late Chief U.S. District Judge Harold Vietor upheld findings in 1988 that the state's prison rules on pornography were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.
Michael Savala, the Iowa prison system's general counsel, told state lawmakers during the session the legislation mirrors a policy currently used by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Iowa prison officials believe the changes will withstand a court challenge from inmates, he said.
""The department really feels that inmates having access to that kind of material does not lend itself to pro-social thinking and behavior and as far as our responsibilities to change the mindset of the offender as they transition back into the community,"" Savala said.
Prison officials also said the elimination of designated prison rooms in which inmates could read sexually oriented material ends a staff-intensive process. Under the old policy, offenders would check out publications and be escorted to a private reading area. When the inmate was finished examining the publication, the magazine would be returned to a staff person, who would inspect it to make sure no pages were been removed and no contraband was inserted into it.
In addition, prison officials said the population of sex offenders has grown significantly in Iowa's prisons since the 1980s and 1990s and prison officials want to keep sexually oriented publications away from them.
However, during Senate debate on the bill, Sen. Rich Taylor, D-Mount Pleasant, a retired Iowa State Penitentiary employee, opposed the legislation. He contended the changes ignore the fact that male inmates have a sexual drive.
""That is just a fact and you have to have some way to relieve that,"" Taylor said. ""This gives the inmates no release point except another offender, and don't think that it doesn't happen.""
Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections, said incarcerated individuals were advised in July that the changes would take effect in mid-November. That gave inmates four months to stop subscriptions to sexually explicit publications and to make arrangements with family and friends, he said.
